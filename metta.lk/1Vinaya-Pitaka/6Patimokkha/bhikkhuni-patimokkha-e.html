</U><B><I><P>The Four Preliminary Functions</P>
</B></I><P>Sweeping the place, lighting a lamp, administering water and spreading seats.</P>
<B><I><P>The Five Functioning Things</P>
</B></I><P>Interest, purity, the suitable time, the number of bhikkhunis and the advice.</P>
<B><I><P>The Four Features To Be Suitable</P>
</B></I><P>The day of the full moon, all the defeated bhikkhunis, those excluded from the Community are not present and the bhikkhunis defeated are at a distance.</P>
<P>The four preliminary functions, the five functions and the four features of suitability completed, we invite the bhikkhunis who have got the consent of the order of bhikkhunis to recite the rules of the higher order.</P>
<B><P>The origin</P>
</B><P>Noble ladies listen, today is the fifteenth day of the full moon, as suitable may the Community of bhikkhunis recite the rules of the bhikkhunis</P>
<P>What are the functions? Noble ladies inform your purity. I will recite the rules of the higher order. All present, listen carefully and attentively. Those that have ecclesiastical offences should voice them. Those who haven't should be silent, by their silence I will know their purity. In a gathering like this, it should be heard up to the third time. When listening to it, up to the third time, if you recall any offences, they should be declared. If a bhikkhuni listening to it, up to the third time, were not to declare an offence that she recalls, it amounts to telling a deliberate lie. The Blessed One has said that telling a deliberate lie is an impediment. Therefore those recalling their offences should declare them, it's for their mental health.</P>
<P>Noble ladies, the origin is recited, how is your purity? For the second and for the third time I ask how is your purity? The noble ladies are pure, therefore they are silent, and I record it as such.</P>
<P>End of the original story.</P>
<B><P>Offences which merit excommunication</P>
</B><P>Now the eight offences are recited.</P>
<P>The training precept for sexual things</P>
<P>1.If a bhikkhuni interested in sexual things practice them in the form of an animal, that is an offence fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
<P>The training precept, for stealing.</P>
<P>2. A bhikkhuni taking from village or forest, something not given with a thievish mind and if it amounts to a robbery for which the king would arrest, execute, imprison, or banish, she does an offence, fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
<P>The training precept, for depriving human life.</P>
<P>3. If a bhikkhuni intentionally deprives human life by providing a weapon or by praising death, or by inciting one to die, saying, `Good man, what is the use of this evil unpleasant life, dying is better than living.' Praising death in various ways makes one to think and ponder about dying, that is an offence, fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
<P>Training precept, for attainments above human.</P>
<P>4. A bhikkhuni impressing others about attainments above human, without attaining them, would say, `I know and see noble attainments and visions above human.' Later, when cross questioned or even not cross questioned, seeing her offence and seeking purity would say: `Noble lady, not knowing or seeing I said I know and see, I said those useless lies, out of conceit'. It's an offence fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
<P>The training precept above the knee caps.</P>
<P>5 If a bhikkhuni with desire consents to a male person's approach to brush up or down, or massage, or take hold, or touch or press above the knee caps, is an offence fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
<P>The training precept for hiding an offence.</P>
<P>6. A bhikkhuni knowing that another bhikkhuni had done an offence, would not accuse her for it, nor inform the Community about it, while she is present and alive Afterwards she would say: `Even earlier, I knew that sister is of such behavior'. Not accusing the bhikkhuni herself, nor informing the Community about it, is an offence fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
<P>Training precept for associating an ex-communicated bhikkhu.</P>
<P>7. A bhikkhuni associating a bhikkhu, rightfully ex communicated by the Teacher's discipline as disrespectful and cannot be corrected, should be advised by the bhikkhunis up to the third time: `Noble lady, this bhikkhu is rightfully ex-communicated by the Teacher's discipline as disrespectful and cannot be corrected do not associate him.' It's good if she gives up the association, if not, it is an offence fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
<P>Training precept, for eight fold misbehavior</P>
<P>8. If a bhikkhuni with desires endures a male person's approaches in the form of holding hands, touching the edge of the robe, standing close, talking or exchanging ideas, or follow him to enclosures, or disclose the body with such intentions, this wrong behavior is an offence fit to be ex-communicated.</P>
<P>The end of the offences, which merit excommunicating</P>
<P>Noble ladies, the eight offences for excommunication are recited. A bhikkhuni fallen for one or the other of these offences is fit to be ex-communicated. Noble ladies, I ask how is your purity? For the second and for the third time I ask how is your purity? The noble ladies are pure, therefore they are silent, and I record it as such.</P>

Not liking you, gossiping about you and because you are weak, they say: `Sisters, you practice wrong behavior, wrong faith, wrong virtues, worry the Community of bhikkhunis hiding each others' faults.

Make yourself available for admonition and you too admonish the bhikkhunis rightfully. The gathering of the Blessed One grows by mutual admonition and rehabilitation of each other.

Noble lady, leave this dwelling, it is for your good.' That bhikkhuni might retort: `The bhikkhunis are led by interest, by anger, by delusion and fear, on account of such an offence a certain one would be sent away and another would not be sent away.' The bhikkhunis should admonish that bhikkhuni: `Noble lady, do not say the bhikkhunis are led by interest, anger, delusion and fear. The noble lady is heard and seen to be visiting a certain family and that family does not approve your behavior. You should leave this dwelling, it's for your own good.' Admonished up to the third time if she gives up the wrong behavior, it's good, if not she falls with an offence for not heeding admonition repeatedly up to the third time and becomes helpless with a serious offence.</P>
<P>Noble ladies, the seventeen serious offences consisting of the nine primary offences and the eight offences for not heeding admonition given up to the third time are recited. A bhikkhuni fallen for one or the other of these offences has to beg pardon in the presence of both Communities. To cut down her conceit the bhikkhuni should be rehabilitated in a place where there is a Community of twenty bhikkhunis. If it happens that the number is less than twenty, she is not rehabilitated and those bhikkhunis are censurable. This is the proper course. Noble ladies, I ask how is your purity? For the second and for the third time I ask how is your purity? The noble ladies are pure, therefore they are silent, and I record it as such.</P>

The novice should be admonished by the bhikkhunis: `Noble lady, the Blessed One did not say that, do not misinterpret the words of the Blessed One.It's not good to misinterpret the Teaching. The Blessed One did not say it. The Blessed One has explained in various ways, that the obstructing things are dangerous and indeed those who indulge in them fall into trouble.' If the novice pursues with the view when admonished by the bhikkhunis this should be said: `Noble lady, from today, the Blessed One is not your Teacher, I stand witness for that. Other novices are favored and could live with the bhikkhunis</P>
<P>for two or three nights, that favor is not for you. Now go and destroy your self. Should a bhikkhuni knowing the novice so destroyed, speak with her, partake food and live with her, it's an offence for atonement.</P>

She had been seen by the other bnhikkhunis listening to the recitation of the rules of the higher order, two or three times, undoubtedly even more. It is not possible that she could get free expressing not knowing. If she had done an offence, she should be dealt accordingly for it and for hiding in delusion: `Noble lady, it is no gain for you, it's a rare chance you get to listen to the recitation of the rules of the higher order attentively.' That delusion is an offence for atonement.</P>

<P>165. A bhikkhuni making a cloth to conceal her skin disease should do it adhering to the following measurements, for four lengths it should be two breadths. If the measurements exceed, and if it's torn, it is an offence for atonement.</P>
