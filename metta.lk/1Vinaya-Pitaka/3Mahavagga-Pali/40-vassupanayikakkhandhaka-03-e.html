<P ALIGN="CENTER">1.</P>
<P>1. At that time the Blessed One dwelt at R&agrave;jagaha, in the Veluvana, in the Kalandakaniv&agrave;pa</FONT><A HREF="#N_1_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (1)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">. At that time the retreat during the rainy season had not yet been instituted by the Blessed One for the bhikkhus. Thus the bhikkhus went on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season.</P>
<P>2. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, `How can the Sakyaputtiya sama&otilde;as go on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season? They crush the green herbs, they hurt vegetable life</FONT><A HREF="#N_2_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (2)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, they destroy the life of many small living things. Shall the ascetics who belong to titthiya schools, whose Doctrine is ill preached, retire during the rainy season and arrange places for themselves to live in</FONT><A HREF="#N_3_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (3)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">? Shall the birds make their nests on the summits of the trees, and retire during [\q 299/] the rainy season, and arrange themselves places to live in; and yet the Sakyaputtiya sama&otilde;as go on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season, crushing the green herbs, hunting vegetable life, and destroying the life of many small things?'</P>
<P>3. Now some bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry.</P>
<P>These bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the bhikkhus:</P>
<P>`I prescribe, O bhikkhus, that you enter upon vassa</FONT><A HREF="#N_4_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (4)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">.'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">______________________</P>

<P>1. Now the bhikkhus thought: `When are we to enter upon vassa?'</P>
<P>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>`I prescribe, O bhikkhus, that you enter upon vassa in the rainy season.'</P>
<P>2. Then the bhikkhus thought: `How many periods are there for entering upon vassa</P>
<P>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>`There are two periods, O bhikkhus, for entering upon vassa, the earlier and the later. The earlier time for entering (upon vassa) is the day after the [\q 300/] full moon of As&agrave;lha (June-July); the later, a month after the full moon of As&agrave;lha</FONT><A HREF="#N_5_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (5)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">. These, O bhikkhus, are the two periods for entering upon vassa.'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">______________________</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">3.</P>
<P>1. At that time the chabbaggiy&agrave; bhikkhus, having entered upon vassa, went on their travels during the period of vassa. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), `How can the Sakyaputtiya sama&otilde;as go on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season (&amp;c., as in chap.1.2, down to:) and destroy the life of many small living things?'</P>
<P>2. Now some bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. The moderate bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), `How can the chabbaggiy&agrave; bhikkhus, having entered upon vassa, go on their travels during the period of vassa?'</P>
<P>These bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. [\q 301/]</P>
<P>In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the bhikkhus.</P>
<P>`Let no one, O bhikkhus, who has entered upon vassa, go on his travels before he has kept vassa during the earlier or during the later three months. He who does so, commits a dukka&ntilde;a offence.'</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">______________________</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">4.</P>
<P>1. At that time the chabbaggiy&agrave; bhikkhus were not willing to enter upon vassa.</P>
<P>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>`Let no one, O bhikkhus, forbear to enter upon vassa. He who does not enter upon vassa, commits a dukka&ntilde;a offence.'</P>
<P>2. At that time the chabbaggiy&agrave; bhikkhus, who were not willing to enter upon vassa on the prescribed day, purposely left the district (where they were living).</P>
<P>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>`Let no one, O bhikkhus, purposely leave the district (where he is living), because he is not willing to enter upon vassa on the prescribed day. He who does, commits a dukka&ntilde;a offence.'</P>
<P>3. At that time the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra, who wished that the vassa period might be postponed, sent a messenger to the bhikkhus: `What if their reverences were to enter upon vassa on the next full moon day?'</P>
<P>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>`I prescribe, O bhikkhus, that you obey kings.'</P>

<P>1. And the Blessed One, after having resided at R&agrave;jagaha as long as He thought fit, went forth to S&agrave;vatthi. Wandering from place to place He came to S&agrave;vatthi. There, at S&agrave;vatthi, the Blessed One dwelt in the Jetavana, the garden of An&agrave;thapindika.</P>
<P>At that time an up&agrave;saka (lay devotee) named Udena, in the Kosala country, had a vih&agrave;ra built for the sa&iuml;gha. He sent a messenger to the bhikkhus (saying), `Might their reverences come hither; I desire to bestow gifts (on the sa&iuml;gha) and to hear the Dhamma and to see the bhikkhus.'</P>
<P>2. The bhikkhus replied: `The Blessed One has prescribed, friend, that no one who has entered upon vassa, may go on a journey before he has kept vassa during the earlier or during the later three months. Let the up&agrave;saka Udena wait so long as the bhikkhus keep their vassa residence; when they have finished vassa, they will go. But if there is any urgent necessity, let him dedicate the vih&agrave;ra in presence of the bhikkhus who reside there.'</P>
<P>3. The up&agrave;saka Udena was annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), `How can their reverences, when I send for them, refuse to come? I am a giver and a doer (of good works), and do service to the fraternity.' Some bhikkhus heard the up&agrave;saka Udena, who was annoyed, &amp;c. These bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>4. In consequence of that the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the bhikkhus:</P>

<P>1. At that time the sa&iuml;gha at S&agrave;vatthi had made an agreement that nobody should receive the pabbajj&agrave; ordination during the rainy season. A grandson of Vis&agrave;kh&agrave; Mig&agrave;ram&agrave;t&agrave;</FONT><A HREF="#N_25_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (25)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> went to the bhikkhus and asked them for the pabbajj&agrave; ordination.

<P>1. At that time the Venerable Upananda Sakyaputta had promised to King Pasenadi of Kosala to take up his vassa residence (with him) at the earlier period</FONT><A HREF="#N_26_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (26)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">. When he was going to the district (where he had consented to go to), he saw on his way two districts in which there were plenty of robes, and he thought: `What if I were to keep vassa in these two districts; thus shall I obtain many robes.' And he kept vassa in those two districts.</P>
<P>King Pasenadi of Kosala was annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), `How can the noble Upananda Sakyaputta, after he has promised us to take up his vassa residence (with us), break his word? Has not falsehood been reproved, and abstinence from falsehood been praised by the Blessed One in many ways?'</P>
<P>2. Some bhikkhus heard King Pasenadi of Kosala, who was annoyed, &amp;c. The moderate bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), `How can the Venerable Upananda Sakyaputta, after he has promised to King Pasenadi of Kosala, &amp;c.? Has not falsehood (&amp;c., as in sect.1)?'</P>
<P>Those bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One. [\q 322/]</P>
<P>In consequence of that, the Blessed One, after having ordered the fraternity of bhikkhus to assemble, asked the Venerable Upananda Sakyaputta: `Is it true, Upananda, that you have broken your word, having promised to King Pasenadi of Kosala to take up your vassa residence (with him)?'</P>
<P>`It is true, Lord'</P>
<P>Then the Blessed Buddha rebuked him: `How can you, O foolish one, break your word, having promised, &amp;c.? Has not falsehood, O foolish one, been reproved, and abstinence from falsehood been praised by me in many ways? This will not do, O foolish one, for converting the unconverted, and for augmenting the number of the converted, but it will result, O foolish one, in the unconverted being repulsed (from the faith) and many of the converted being estranged.'</P>
<P>Having reproved him and delivered a religious discourse He thus addressed the bhikkhus:</P>
<P>4. `In case, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has promised (to a lay-devotee) to take up his vassa residence (with him) at the earlier period, and when he goes to that district, he sees on his way two districts in which there are plenty of robes, and he thinks: "What if I were to keep vassa in these two districts ; thus shall I obtain many robes;" and he keeps vassa in those two districts. This bhikkhu's (entering upon vassa), O bhikkhus, (at the) earlier period is not valid, and as to his promise he has committed a dukka&ntilde;a offence.</P>
<P>5. `In case, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has promised (to a lay-devotee) to take up his vassa residence with him) at the earlier period, and when going to that district, he holds Uposatha outside (on the last [\q 323/] day of the half month), and on the first day (of the next half month) he goes to the vih&agrave;ra, prepares himself a place of rest, gets (water to) drink and food, sweeps the cell, and goes away that same day without having any business.

<P>6. `In case, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has promised, &amp;c., and having resided there two or three days, he goes away without having any business, &amp;c.; he goes away having business. This bhikkhu's (entering upon vassa)(&amp;c., as in sect.4, down to) offence.</P>

At that time the retreat during the rainy season had not yet been instituted by the Blessed One for the bhikkhus. Thus the bhikkhus went on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season.</P>
<P>2. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, `How can the Sakyaputtiya sama&otilde;as go on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season? They crush the green herbs, they hurt vegetable life</FONT><A HREF="#N_32_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (32)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, they destroy the life of many small living things.

<P>3. Now some bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry.</P>
<P>These bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the bhikkhus:</P>

<P>2. Then the bhikkhus thought: `How many periods are there for entering upon vassa</P>
<P>They told this thing to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>`There are two periods, O bhikkhus, for entering upon vassa, the earlier and the later. The earlier time for entering (upon vassa) is the day after the [\q 300/] full moon of As&agrave;lha (June-July); the later, a month after the full moon of As&agrave;lha</FONT><A HREF="#N_35_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (35)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">.

<P>These bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. [\q 301/]</P>
<P>In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the bhikkhus.</P>
<P>`Let no one, O bhikkhus, who has entered upon vassa, go on his travels before he has kept vassa during the earlier or during the later three months. He who does so, commits a dukka&ntilde;a offence.'</P>

<P>1. And the Blessed One, after having resided at R&agrave;jagaha as long as He thought fit, went forth to S&agrave;vatthi. Wandering from place to place He came to S&agrave;vatthi. There, at S&agrave;vatthi, the Blessed One dwelt in the Jetavana, the garden of An&agrave;thapindika.</P>
<P>At that time an up&agrave;saka (lay devotee) named Udena, in the Kosala country, had a vih&agrave;ra built for the sa&iuml;gha. He sent a messenger to the bhikkhus (saying), `Might their reverences come hither; I desire to bestow gifts (on the sa&iuml;gha) and to hear the Dhamma and to see the bhikkhus.'</P>
<P>2. The bhikkhus replied: `The Blessed One has prescribed, friend, that no one who has entered upon vassa, may go on a journey before he has kept vassa during the earlier or during the later three months. Let the up&agrave;saka Udena wait so long as the bhikkhus keep their vassa residence; when they have finished vassa, they will go. But if there is any urgent necessity, let him dedicate the vih&agrave;ra in presence of the bhikkhus who reside there.'</P>
<P>3. The up&agrave;saka Udena was annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), `How can their reverences, when I send for them, refuse to come? I am a giver and a doer (of good works), and do service to the fraternity.' Some bhikkhus heard the up&agrave;saka Udena, who was annoyed, &amp;c.

<P>`I allow you, O bhikkhus, to go (even during [\q 303/] the rainy season), if the affair for which you go can be accomplished in seven days, and if you are sent for, but not if you are not sent for, by a person of one of the following seven classes: bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, sikkham&agrave;n&agrave;s</FONT><A HREF="#N_36_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (36)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, s&agrave;maneras, s&agrave;maneris, lay devotees, female lay devotees.

<P>When those bhikkhus had concluded the vassa residence, they said to the grandson of Vis&agrave;kh&agrave; Mig&agrave;ram&agrave;t&agrave;: `Come now, friend, you may receive the pabbajj&agrave; ordination.' He replied: `If I had received the pabbajj&agrave; ordination before, Reverend Sirs, I should remain (in the religious life), but now, Reverend Sirs, I will not receive the pabbajj&agrave; ordination.'</P>
<P>2. Vis&agrave;kh&agrave; Mig&agrave;ram&agrave;t&agrave; was annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), `How can the noble ones make such an agreement that nobody shall receive the pabbajj&agrave; ordination during the rainy season? At what time ought the duties of the Dhamma not to be performed?'</P>
<P>Some bhikkhus heard Vis&agrave;kh&agrave; Mig&agrave;ram&agrave;t&agrave;, who was annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. [\q 321/]</P>
<P>Those bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>`Such an agreement, O bhikkhus, ought not to be made -- that nobody shall receive the pabbajj&agrave; ordination during the rainy season. He who makes (an agreement like this), commits a dukka&ntilde;a offence.'</P>

<P>1. At that time the Venerable Upananda Sakyaputta had promised to King Pasenadi of Kosala to take up his vassa residence (with him) at the earlier period</FONT><A HREF="#N_56_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (56)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">. When he was going to the district (where he had consented to go to), he saw on his way two districts in which there were plenty of robes, and he thought: `What if I were to keep vassa in these two districts; thus shall I obtain many robes.' And he kept vassa in those two districts.</P>
<P>King Pasenadi of Kosala was annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), `How can the noble Upananda Sakyaputta, after he has promised us to take up his vassa residence (with us), break his word? Has not falsehood been reproved, and abstinence from falsehood been praised by the Blessed One in many ways?'</P>
<P>2. Some bhikkhus heard King Pasenadi of Kosala, who was annoyed, &amp;c. The moderate bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), `How can the Venerable Upananda Sakyaputta, after he has promised to King Pasenadi of Kosala, &amp;c.? Has not falsehood (&amp;c., as in sect.1)?'</P>
<P>Those bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One. [\q 322/]</P>
<P>In consequence of that, the Blessed One, after having ordered the fraternity of bhikkhus to assemble, asked the Venerable Upananda Sakyaputta: `Is it true, Upananda, that you have broken your word, having promised to King Pasenadi of Kosala to take up your vassa residence (with him)?'</P>
<P>`It is true, Lord'</P>
<P>Then the Blessed Buddha rebuked him: `How can you, O foolish one, break your word, having promised, &amp;c.? Has not falsehood, O foolish one, been reproved, and abstinence from falsehood been praised by me in many ways? This will not do, O foolish one, for converting the unconverted, and for augmenting the number of the converted, but it will result, O foolish one, in the unconverted being repulsed (from the faith) and many of the converted being estranged.'</P>
<P>Having reproved him and delivered a religious discourse He thus addressed the bhikkhus:</P>
<P>4. `In case, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has promised (to a lay-devotee) to take up his vassa residence (with him) at the earlier period, and when he goes to that district, he sees on his way two districts in which there are plenty of robes, and he thinks: "What if I were to keep vassa in these two districts ; thus shall I obtain many robes;" and he keeps vassa in those two districts. This bhikkhu's (entering upon vassa), O bhikkhus, (at the) earlier period is not valid, and as to his promise he has committed a dukka&ntilde;a offence.</P>
<P>5. `In case, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has promised (to a lay-devotee) to take up his vassa residence with him) at the earlier period, and when going to that district, he holds Uposatha outside (on the last [\q 323/] day of the half month), and on the first day (of the next half month) he goes to the vih&agrave;ra, prepares himself a place of rest, gets (water to) drink and food, sweeps the cell, and goes away that same day without having any business. This bhikkhu's (entering upon vassa) (&amp;c., as in sect.4, down to) offence.</P>
<P>`In case, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has promised (&amp;c., as in the preceding case, down to:) and goes away that same day having business. This bhikkhu's (entering upon vassa) (&amp;c., as in sect.4, down to) offence.</P>
<P>6. `In case, O bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has promised, &amp;c., and having resided there two or three days, he goes away without having any business, &amp;c.; he goes away having business. This bhikkhu's (entering upon vassa)(&amp;c., as in sect.4, down to) offence.</P>
