The Uposatha service for this whole district was performed in the Veluvana monastery.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+" SIZE=2><P><A NAME="N_18_"></A>18.&nbsp; Tic&atilde;varena avippav&agrave;sa means not parting with the three robes which belong to the usual `parikkh&agrave;r&agrave;' (requisites) of a bhikkhu. Bhikkhus were not allowed to part with their civaras, excepting under special circumstances and for a limited time (see the P&agrave;timokkha, 29th nissaggiya dhamma). Conferring the character of ticivarena avippav&agrave;sa on a boundary means, we believe, to determine that it should be free td bhikkhus residing within this boundary, to keep a set of robes wherever they liked within the same boundary (excepting in a village, sect. 3), and that such an act should not be considered as parting with the robes.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+" SIZE=2><P><A NAME="N_19_"></A>19.&nbsp; Buddhaghosa observes that this rule applies to bhikkhus only and not to bhikkhunis. For bhikkhunis reside only in villages; there would be no civaraparih&agrave;ra at all for bhikkhunis, if they were to use the kammav&agrave;c&agrave; given in sect. 4. Buddhaghosa also observes at this occasion that the boundaries of the bhikkhusa&iuml;gha and of the bhikkhunisa&iuml;gha are quite independent from each other and that the rules given in chap. 13 do not refer to boundaries the one of which belongs to the bhikkhusa&iuml;gha, the other to the bhikkhunisa&iuml;gha.</FONT> </P>
