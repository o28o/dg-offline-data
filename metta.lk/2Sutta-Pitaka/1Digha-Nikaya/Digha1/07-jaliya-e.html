[IS THE SOUL DISTINCT FROM THE BODY?]</P>
</B><P>[This Sutta having been incorporated, word for word, as Sections 15-19, inclusive, in the last Sutta, the reader is referred to the translation given there.</P>
<P>The Mah&agrave;li Sutta must have already included, when the D&atilde;gha was put together, this J&agrave;liya episode. For there would otherwise be no reason for the Mah&agrave;li Sutta being put into the S&atilde;lakkhanda Vagga, the S&atilde;las being contained only in that episode.</P>
<P>Why then should the episode appear also again, in full, as a separate Sutta? Is it merely because of the importance of the question? We have another instance of a similar kind, where the episode of Nigrodha's question, only referred to at Section 23 of the Kassapa-S&atilde;han&agrave;da Sutta, is set out afterwards, in full, in the Udumbar&atilde;ka S&atilde;han&agrave;da Sutta (No. 25 in the D&atilde;gha). But there the whole episode is not given twice in full. Such cross-references are fairly frequent in the Pi&ntilde;akas, and are of importance for the history of the literature. One of the most striking cases is where the Sa&uuml;yutta quotes a Sutta, now contained in the D&atilde;gha, by name. (Sakkapa¤ha Sutta, S. III, 13; compare Sum. I, 51; Mil. 350.)]</P>
