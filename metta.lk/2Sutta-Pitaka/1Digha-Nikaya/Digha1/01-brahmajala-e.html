TO THE<BR>
BRAHMA-J&acirc;LA SUTTA</P>
</B><P>THE phase of </FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+" SIZE=4>beliefs</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> which this Suttanta is intended to meet, into which its argument fits, has been set out in some setail in the opening chapter of my `American Lectures.' As there pointed out <A NAME="BM1"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n1">1</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">], the discussion which thus opens this series of dialogues forms also the first question in the Kath&agrave; Vatthu, and the first question in the Milinda. We cannot be far wrong if, in our endeavours to understand the real meaning of the original Buddhism, we attach as much weight to this question as did the author or authors of these ancient and authoritative Buddhist books.</P>
<P>The Suttanta sets out in sixty-two divisions <A NAME="BM2"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n2">2</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] various speculations or theories in which the theorisers, going out always from various forms of the ancient view of a `soul'-a sort of subtle manikin inside the body but separate from it, and continuing, after it leaves the body, as a separate entity-attempt to reconstruct the past, or to arrange the future. All such speculation is condemned. And necessarily so, since the Buddhist philosophy is put together without this ancient idea of `soul.'</P>
<P>The Buddhist scheme endeavours, in other words, to include all the truth which previous thinkers had grafted on to the old savage theories of a semi-material, subtle, permanent entity inside the body, while rejecting those theories themselves; it endeavours to retain all the philosophic truth which previous thinkers had grafted on to the theosophies-the corollaries of the soul theories-while rejecting those theosophies themselves. The reasons given for this position are threefold firstly, that such speculators about ultimate things, [\q xxvi/] either in the past or the future, have insufficient evidence. see only one side of the shield; <A NAME="BM3"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n3">3</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] secondly, that such speculations do not lead to emancipation, to Arahatship; <A NAME="BM4"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n4">4</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] and thirdly, that such theories are really derived from the hopes, the feelings, and the sensations arising from evanescent phenomena <A NAME="BM5"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n5">5</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">]-they belong, in other words, to the realm of hastily formed, empirical opinion (di&ntilde;&ntilde;hi), not to that of' the higher wisdom (pa¤¤&agrave;). So that Buddhism, in the first place, holds a position somewhat similar to the modern Agnostic position. Secondly, while acknowledging the importance of feeling and of intellect, it lays special stress upon the regulation, the cultivation, of the Will <A NAME="BM6"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n6">6</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">]. And thirdly, it distinguishes between a lower and a higher wisdom, <A NAME="BM7"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n7">7</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">].</P>
<P>Several scholars, and especially&THORN;with more knowledge and detail&THORN;Dr. Karl Neumann, have maintained that the position of Buddhism in the history of Indian philosophy is analogous to that of Schopenhauer in European philosophy. On the other hand, it is maintained by Professor Deussen that Schopenhauer's position is analogous to that of the Upanishads. The reconciliation will probably be found to be that what Buddhism took over, with more or less of modification, from the Upanishads, is about the same as that part of the Upanishad doctrine which is found, in European phraseology, in Schopenhauer; and what Buddhism rejected alto-ether is not to be found in Schopenhauer. He himself, who however knew both systems only from second-hand and inaccurate authorities, says, `If I am to take the results of my own Philosophy as the standard of truth, I should be obliged to concede to Buddhism the pre-eminence over other (systems of philosophy).'</P>
<P>However this question may be decided-and its discussion, at the necessary length, by a competent student of philosophy, is a very pressing want-it is certain from the details given in our Suttanta that there were then current in Northern India many other philosophic and theosophic speculations besides those the priests found it expedient to adopt, and have preserved for us in the Upanishads. And who can doubt but that some, if not all of them, may also have had their influence on the new doctrine? There was always much philosophising in India outside the narrow and inexact limits [\q xxvii/] of the so-called six Darsanas; and we have to thank Buddhist scholars for preserving, in their P&agrave;li and Sanskrit works, the evidences of such philosophy as the priests wished to exclude from notice <A NAME="BM8"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n8">8</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">].</P>

<B>The Perfect Net</P>
</B><P>1. Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once going along the high road between R&agrave;jagaha and N&agrave;land&agrave; <A NAME="BM10"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n10">10</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] with a great company of the brethren, with about five hundred brethren. And Suppiya the mendicant <A NAME="BM11"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n11">11</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] too was going along the high road between R&agrave;jagaha and N&agrave;land&agrave; with his disciple the youth Brahmadatta. Now just then Suppiya the mendicant was speaking in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, in dispraise of the Doctrine, in dispraise of the Order. But young Brahmadatta, his pupil, gave utterance, in many ways, to praise of the Buddha, to praise of the Doctrine, to praise of the Order. Thus. they two, teacher and pupil, holding opinions in direct contradiction one to the other, were following, step by [\q 002/] step, after the Blessed One and the company of the brethren.</P>
<P>2. Now the Blessed One put up at the royal rest-house in the Ambala&ntilde;&ntilde;hik&agrave;. pleasance <A NAME="BM12"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n12">12</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] to pass the night, and with him the company of the brethren. And so also did Suppiya the mendicant, and with him his young disciple Brahmadatta. And there, at the rest-house, these two carried on the same discussion as before.</P>
<P>[2] 3. And in the early dawn a number of the brethren assembled, as they rose up, in the pavilion; and this was the trend of the talk that sprang up among them, as they were seated there. `How wonderful a thing is it, brethren, and how strange that the Blessed One, he who knows and sees, the Arahat, the Buddha Supreme, should so clearly have perceived how various are the inclinations of men! For see how while Suppiya the mendicant speaks in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Doctrine, and the Order, his own disciple young Brahmadatta, speaks, in as many ways, in praise of them. So do these two, teacher and pupil, follow step by step after the Blessed One and the company of the brethren, giving utterance to views in direct contradiction one to the other.'</P>
<P>4. Now the Blessed One, on realising what was the drift of their talk, went to the pavilion, and took his seat on the mat spread out for him. And when he had sat down he said: `What is the talk on which you are engaged sitting here, and what is the subject of the conversation between you?' And they told him all. And he said:</P>
<P>[\q 003/] <B>Minor Details Of Mere Morality</P>
</B><P>5. `Brethren, if outsiders should speak against me, or against the Doctrine, or against the Order, you should not on that account either bear malice, or suffer heart-burning, or feel ill will. If you, on that account, should be angry and hurt, that would stand in the way of your, own self-conquest. If, when others speak against us, you feel angry at that, and displeased, would you then be able to judge how far that speech of theirs is well said or ill?'</P>
<P>`That would not be so, Sir.'</P>
<P>`But when outsiders speak in dispraise of me, or of the Doctrine, or of the Order, you should unravel what is false and point it out as wrong, saying: &szlig;For this or that reason this is not the fact, that is not so, such a thing is not found among us, is not in us.&ucirc;</P>
<P>6. `But also, brethren, if outsiders should speak in praise of me, in praise of the Doctrine, in praise of the Order, you should not, on that account, be filled with pleasure or gladness, or be lifted up in heart. Were you to be so that also would stand in the way of your self-conquest. When outsiders speak in praise of me, or of the Doctrine, or of the Order, you should acknowledge what is right to be the fact, saying: &szlig;For this or that reason this is the fact, that is so, such a thing is found among us, is in us.&ucirc;</P>
<P>7. `It is in respect only of trifling things, of matters of little value, of mere morality, that an unconverted man, when praising the Tath&agrave;gata, would speak. And what are such trifling, minor details of mere morality that he would praise.</P>

</B><P>8. &szlig;Putting away the killing of living things, Gotama the recluse holds aloof from the destruction [\q 004/] of life. He has laid the cudgel and the sword aside, and ashamed of roughness, and full of mercy, he dwells compassionate and kind to all creatures that have life&ucirc; It is thus that the unconverted man, when-speaking in praise of the Tath&agrave;gata, might speak <A NAME="BM14"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n14">14</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">].</P>
<P>`Or he might say: &szlig;Putting away the taking of what has not been given, Gotama the recluse lived aloof from grasping what is not his own. He takes only what is given, and expecting that gifts will come <A NAME="BM15"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n15">15</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">], he passes his life in honesty and purity of heart.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Or he might say: &szlig;Putting away unchastity, Gotama the recluse is chaste. He holds himself aloof, far off, from the vulgar practice, from the sexual act <A NAME="BM16"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n16">16</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">].&ucirc;</P>
<P>9. `Or he might say: &szlig;Putting away lying words, Gotama the recluse holds himself aloof from falsehood. He speaks truth, from the truth he never swerves; faithful and trustworthy, he breaks not his word to the world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>`Or he might say: &szlig;Putting away slander, Gotama the recluse holds himself aloof from calumny. What he hears here he repeats not elsewhere to raise a quarrel [\q 005/] against the people here; what he hears elsewhere he repeats not here to raise a quarrel against the people there. Thus does he live as a binder together of those who are divided, an encourager of those who are friends, a peacemaker, a lover of peace, impassioned for peace, a speaker of words that make for peace.&ucirc;</P>
<P>`Or he might say: &szlig;Putting- away rudeness of speech, Gotama the recluse holds himself aloof from harsh language. Whatsoever word is blameless, pleasant to the car, lovely, reaching to the heart, urbane <A NAME="BM17"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n17">17</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">], pleasing to the people, beloved of the people-such are words he speaks.&ucirc;</P>

In season he speaks, in accordance with the facts, words full of meaning, on religion, on the discipline of the Order.

He takes but one meal a day, not eating at night, refraining from food after hours (after midday).<BR>
He refrains from being a spectator at shows at fairs, with nautch dances, singing, and music.<BR>

Because I, by means of ardour of exertion of application of earnestness of careful thought, can reach up to such rapture of heart that, rapt in heart, I can call to mind, and in full detail both of condition and of custom, my various dwelling-places in times gone by-by that is it that I know this-that the soul is eternal; and that the world, giving birth to nothing new, is stedfast as a mountain peak, as a pillar firmly fixed; and that though these living creatures transmigrate and pass away, fall from one state of existence and spring up in another, yet they are forever and ever.&ucirc;</P>

<P>34. [16] `And in the fourth place, brethren, on what ground is it, starting from what, that those venerable ones are Eternalists, and maintain that the soul and the world are eternal.</P>
<P>`In this case, brethren, some recluse or Brahman [\q 029/] is addicted to logic and reasoning.

<P>&szlig;'This, brethren, is the fourth state of things on the ground of which, starting from which, some recluses and Brahmans are Eternalists, and maintain that the soul and the world are eternal.</P>

<P>36. `Now of these, brethren, the Tath&agrave;gata knows that these speculations thus arrived at, thus insisted on, will have such and such a result, such and such an effect on the future condition of those who trust in them.

<P>2. `Now there comes a time, brethren, when, sooner or later, after the lapse of a long long period, this world-system passes away.

<P>4. `Now there arises in him, from his dwelling there so long alone, a dissatisfaction and a longing: &szlig;O! would that other beings might come to join me in this place! " And just then, either because their span of years had passed or their merit was exhausted, other beings fall from the World of Radiance, and appear in the Palace of Brahma as companions to him, and in all respects like him. [18]</P>
<P>5. `On this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to himself: &szlig;I am Brahm&agrave;, the Great Brahm&agrave;, the Supreme One, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days the Father of all that are and are to be <A NAME="BM154"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n154">154</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">]. `These other beings are of my creation. And why is that so? A while ago I thought, `Would that they might come!' And on my mental aspiration, behold the beings came.&ucirc;</P>
<P>`And those beings themselves, too, think thus: &szlig;This must be Brahm&agrave;,, the Great Brahm&agrave;, the Supreme, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days, the Father of all that are [\q 032/] and are to be. And we must have been created by him. And why? Because, as we see, it was he who was here first, and we came after that.&ucirc;</P>
<P>6. `On this, brethren, the one who first came into existence there is of longer life, and more glorious, and more powerful than those who appeared after him. And it might well be, brethren, that some being on his falling from that state, should come hither. And having come hither he might go forth from the household life into the homeless state. And having thus become a recluse he, by reason of ardour of exertion of application of earnestness of careful thought, reaches up to such rapture of heart that, rapt in heart, he calls to mind his last dwelling-place, but not the previous ones. He says to himself: &szlig;That illustrious Brahm&agrave;, the Great Brahm&agrave;, the Supreme One, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days, the Father of all that are and are to be, he by whom we were created, he is stedfast immutable eternal, of a nature that knows no change, and he will remain so forever and ever. But we who were created by him have come hither as being impermanent mutable limited in duration of life.</P>
<P>[19] `This, brethren, is the first state of things on account of which, starting out from which, some recluses and Brahmans, being Eternalists as to some things, and Non-eternalists as to others, maintain that the soul and the world are partly eternal and partly not.</P>
<P>7. `And what is the second?</P>
<P>`There are, brethren, certain gods called the &szlig;Debauched by Pleasure&ucirc; <A NAME="BM155"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n155">155</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">]. `For ages they pass their time in the pursuit of the laughter and sport of sensual lusts.

<P>[\q 033/] 8. `Now it might well be, brethren, that some being, on his falling from that state, should come hither. And having come hither he should, as in the last case, become a recluse, and acquire the power of recollecting his last birth, but only his last one.</P>
<P>9. `And he would say to himself: &szlig;Those gods who are not debauched by pleasure are stedfast, immutable, eternal, of a nature that knows no change, and they will remain so forever and ever. [20] But we-who fell from that state, having lost our self-control through being debauched by pleasure-we have come hither as being impermanent, mutable, limited in duration of life.&ucirc;</P>
<P>10. `And what is the third?</P>
<P>`There are, brethren, certain gods called "the Debauched in Mind <A NAME="BM157"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n157">157</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">].&ucirc; They burn continually with envy <A NAME="BM158"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n158">158</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] one against another, and being thus irritated, their hearts become ill-disposed towards each other, and being thus debauched, their bodies become feeble, and their minds imbecile. And those gods fall from that state.</P>
<P>11. `Now it might well be, brethren, that some [\q 034/] being, on his falling from that state, should come hither; and having become a recluse should `as in the other cases, acquire the power of recollecting his last birth, but only his last one.</P>
<P>12. `And lie would say to himself: &szlig;Those gods who are not debauched in mind do not continually burn with envy against each other, so their hearts do not become evil disposed one towards another, nor their bodies feeble and their minds imbecile. Therefore they fall not from that state; they are stedfast, immutable, eternal, of a nature that knows no change, and they will remain so forever and ever. [21] But we were corrupted in mind, being constantly excited by envy against one another. And being thus envious and corrupt our bodies became feeble, and our minds imbecile, and we fell from that state, and have come hither as Being impermanent, mutable, limited in duration of life.&ucirc;</P>
<P>`This, brethren, is the third case.</P>
<P>13. `And what is the fourth?</P>
<P>In this case, brethren, some recluse or Brahman is addicted to logic and reasoning. He gives utterance to the following conclusion of his own, beaten out by his argumentations and based on his sophistry: &szlig;This which is called eye and ear and nose and tongue and body is a self which is impermanent, unstable, not eternal, subject to change. But this which is called heart, or mind, or consciousness is a self which is permanent, stedfast, eternal, and knows no change, and it will remain forever and ever <A NAME="BM159"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n159">159</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">].</P>
<P>This, brethren, is the fourth state of things, on the ground of which, starting from which, some recluses [\q 035/] and Brahmans are Semi-eternalists, and in four ways maintain that the soul and the world are in some respects eternal, and in some not.</P>
<P>14. `These, brethren, are those recluses and Brahmans who are Semi-eternalists, and in four ways maintain that the soul and the world are eternal in some cases and not in others. For whosoever of the recluses and Brahmans are such and maintain this, they do so in these four ways or in one or other of the same; and outside these there is no way in which this opinion is arrived at.</P>
<P>[22] 15. `Now of these, brethren, the Tath&agrave;gata knows that these speculations, thus arrived at, thus insisted on, will have such and such a result, such and such an effect on the future condition of those who trust in them. That does he know, and he knows also other things far beyond (far better than those speculations); and having that knowledge, he is not puffed up, and thus untarnished he has, in his own heart, realised the way of escape from them, has understood, as they really are, the rising up and passing away of sensations, their sweet taste, their danger, how they cannot be relied on, and not grasping after any (of those things men are eager for) he, the Tath&agrave;gata, is quite set free.</P>
<P>`These, brethren, are those other things, profound, difficult to realise, hard to understand, tranquillising, sweet, not to be grasped by mere logic, subtle, comprehensible only by the wise, which the Tath&agrave;gata, having himself realised and seen face to face, hath set forth; and it is concerning these that they who would rightly praise the Tath&agrave;gata in accordance with the truth, should speak.'</P>
<I><P>The Extensionists</P>

<P>17. `In the first case, brethren, some recluse or Brahman, by means of ardour of exertion of application of earnestness of careful thought, reaches up to such rapture of heart that he, rapt in heart., dwells in the world imagining it finite.

<P>18. `The second case is similar, only that the conclusion is: [23] `Infinite is the world without a limit.

<P>20. `In the fourth case, brethren, some recluse or Brahman is addicted to logic and reasoning. He gives utterance to the following conclusion of his own, beaten out by his argumentations and based on his sophistry: &szlig;This world is neither finite nor yet infinite.

The most ancient coins, which were of private (not state) coinage, were either of bronze or gold. Buddhaghosa (p.79) explains the expression here used as meaning the passing off of bronze vessels as gold. Gogerly translates `weights,' Childers sub voce has `counterfeit metal,' and Neumann has `M&agrave;ss.' Buddhaghosa is obliged to take ka&uuml;sa in the meaning of `gold pot,' which seems very forced; and there is no authority for ka&uuml;sa meaning either weight or mass.

Clough first translated it so in his Sinhalese Dictionary, p. 665, and he was followed by Gogerly, Burnouf, myself (in `Buddhist Suttas,' p. 192), and Dr. Neumann (p. 69),-and Weber (Indian Literature, pp. 199, 319) seems to approve this. But it is most unlikely that the theatre was already known in the fifth century B. C. And Buddhaghosa (p. 84) explains it, quite simply, as na&ntilde;a-samajj&agrave;. Now samajjo is a very interesting old word (at least in its P&agrave;li form). The Sanskrit, according to the Petersburg Dictionary, has only been found in modern dictionaries. The P&agrave;li occurs in other old texts such as Vinaya 11, 107; IV, 267 (both times in the very same context as it does here); ibid. II, 150; 1V, 85; Sig&agrave;lov&agrave;da Sutta, p.300; and it is undoubtedly the same word as sam&agrave;ja in the first of the fourteen Edicts of Asoka. In the Sig&agrave;lov&agrave;da there are said to be six dangers at such a samajjo; to wit, dancing, singing, music, recitations, conjuring tricks, and acrobatic shows. And in the Vinaya passages we learn that at a samajjo not only amusements but also food was provided; that high officials were invited, and had special seats; and that it took place at the top of a bill. This last detail of `high places' (that is sacred places) points to a religious motive as underlying the whole procedure. The root aj (??greak??agw??, ago, whence our `act') belongs to the stock of common Aryan roots, and means carrying on. What was the meaning of this `carrying on together'? Who were the people who took part? Were they confined to one village? or have we here a survival from old exogamic communistic dancings together? Later the word means simply fair,' as at J&agrave;taka III, 541:</P>
<P>`Many the bout 1 have played with quarterstaves at the fair,' with which J&agrave;taka I, 394 may be compared. And it is no doubt this side of the festival which is here in the mind of the author; but `fair' is nevertheless a very inadequate rendering.

This would bring the word into connection with the Sanskrit vait&agrave;&euml;ika, `royal bard.' The other explanation connects the word with Vet&agrave;la, `a demon,' supposed to play pranks (as in the stories of the Vet&agrave;la-pa¤ca-vi&uuml;sati) by reanimating corpses. Dr. Neumann adopts it. But it does not agree so well with the context; and it seems scarcely justifiable to see, in this ancient list, a reference to beliefs which can only be traced in literature more than a thousand years later.
