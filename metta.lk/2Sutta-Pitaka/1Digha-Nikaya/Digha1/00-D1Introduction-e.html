<a name="NoteOnTheProbableAge"></a>[\q ix/] <b>NOTE ON THE PROBABLE
AGE OF THE DIALOGUES</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">THE Dialogues of the Buddha, constituting,
in the P‡li text, the D„gha and Majjhima Nik‡yas, contain a full
exposition of what the early Buddhists considered the teaching of the
Buddha to have been. Incidentally they contain a large number of
references to the social, political, and religious condition of India
at the time when they were put together. We do not know for certain
what that time exactly was. But every day is adding to the number of
facts on which an approximate estimate of the date may be based. And
the ascertained facts are already sufficient to give us a fair working
hypothesis. In the first place the numerous details and comparative
tables given in the Introduction to my translation of the Milinda show
without a doubt that practically the whole of the P‡li PiÒakas were
known, and regarded as final authority, at the time and place when that
work was composed. The geographical details given on pp. xliii, xliv
tend to show that the work was composed in the extreme North-West of
India. There are two Chinese works, translations of Indian books taken
to China from the North of India, which contain, in different
recessions, the introduction [\q x/] and the opening chapters of the
Milinda <a name="BM1"></a>[</font><a href="#n1">1</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">] For the reasons adduced <i>(loco citato) </i>it
is evident that the work must have been composed at or about the time
of the Christian era. Whether (as M. Sylvain Levy thinks) it is an
enlarged work built up on the foundation of the Indian original of the
Chinese books; or whether (as I am inclined to think) that original is
derived from our Milinda, there is still one conclusion that must be
drawnﬁthe Nik‡yas, nearly if not quite as we now have them in the P‡li,
were <i>known at a very early date in the North of India. </i>Then
again, the Kath‡ Vatthu (according to the views prevalent, at the end
of the fourth century A. D., at K‡ıcipura in South India, and at
Anur‡dhapura in Ceylon; and recorded, therefore, in their commentaries,
by Dhammap‡la and Buddhaghosa) was composed, in the form in which we
now have it, by Tissa, the son of Moggal„, in the middle of the third
century B. C., at the court of Asoka, at P‡Òaliputta, the modern Patna,
in the North of India. It is a recognised rule of evidence in the
courts of law that, if an entry be found in the books kept by a man in
the ordinary course of his trade, which entry speaks <i>against </i>himself,
then that entry is especially worthy of credence. Now at the time when
they made this entry about Tissa's authorship of the Kath‡ Vatthu the
commentators believed, and it was an accepted tenet of those among whom
they mixedﬁjust as it was, <i>mutatis mutandis, </i>among the
theologians in Europe, at the corresponding date in the history of <i>their
</i>faithﬁthat the whole of the canon was the word of the Buddha. They
also held that it had been actually recited, at the Council of
R‡jagaha, immediately after his decease. It is, I venture to submit,
absolutely impossible, under these circumstances, that the commentators
can have invented this information [\q xi/] about Tissa and the Kath‡
Vatthu. They found it in the records on which their works are based.
They dared not alter it. The best they could do was to try to explain.
it away. And this they did by a story, evidently Legendary, attributing
the first scheming out of the book to the Buddha. But they felt
compelled to hand on, as they found it, the record of Tissa's
authorship. And this deserves, on the ground that it is evidence
against themselves, to have great weight attached to it. The text of
the Kath‡ Vatthu now lies before us in a scholarly edition, prepared
for the P‡li Text Society by Mr. Arnold C. Taylor. It purports to be a
refutation by Tissa Of 250 erroneous opinions held by Buddhists
belonging to schools of thought different from his own. We have, from
other sources, a considerable number of data as regards the different
schools of thought among Buddhistsﬁoften erroneously called `the
Eighteen Sects'. <a name="BM2"></a>[</font><a href="#n2">2</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">] We are beginning to know something about the
historical development of Buddhism, and to be familiar with what sort
of questions are likely to have arisen. We are beginning to know
something of the growth of the language, of the different P‡li styles.
In all these respects the Kath‡ Vatthu fits in with what we should
expect as possible, and probable, in the time of Asoka, and in the
North of India. Now the discussions as carried on in the Kath‡ Vatthu
are for the most part, and on both sides, an appeal to authority. And
to what authority ? Without any exception as yet discovered, to the
PiÒakas, and as we now have them, in P‡li. Thus on p. 339 the appeal is
to the passage translated below, on p. 278, ? 6 ; and it is quite
evident that the quotation is from our Suttanta, and not from any other
passage where [\q xii/] the same words might occur, as the very name of
the Suttanta, the Kevaddha (with a difference of reading found also in
our MSS.), is given. The following are other instances of quotations:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">There are many more quotations from the
older PiÒaka books in the Kath‡ Vatthu, about three or four times as
many as are contained in this list. But this is enough to show that, <i>at
the time when the Kath‡ Vatthu was composed, all the Five Nik‡yas were
extant; and were considered to be final authorities in any question
that was being discussed. </i>They must themselves, therefore, be
considerably older. Thirdly, Hofrath BÅhler and Dr. Hultsch have called
attention <a name="BM3"></a>[</font><a href="#n3">3</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">] to the fact that in inscriptions of the third
century B. C. we find, as descriptions of donors to the <i>d‡gabas</i>,
the expressions <i>dhammakathika, peÒak„, suttantika, suttantakin„,</i>
and <i>paıca-nek‡yika</i>. [\q xiii/] The Dhamma, the PiÒakas, the
Suttantas, and the five Nik‡yas must have existed for some time before
the brethren and sisters could be described as preachers of the Dhamma,
as reciters of the PiÒaka, and as guardians of the Suttantas or of the
Nik‡yas (which were not yet written, and were only kept alive in the
memory of living men and women). Simple as they seem, the exact force
of these technical designations is not, as yet, determined. Dr. K.
Neumann thinks that <i>PeÒak„</i> does not mean `knowing the PiÒakas,'
but `knowing the PiÒaka,' that is, the Nik‡yasﬁa single PiÒaka, in the
sense of the Dhamma, having been known before the expression `the
PiÒakas' came into use. <a name="BM4"></a>[</font><a href="#n4">4</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">] As he points out, the title of the old work
PeÒakopadesa, which is an exposition, not of the three PiÒakas, but
only of the Nik‡yas, supports his view. So again the Dialogues are the
only parts or passages of the canonical books called, in our MSS.,
suttantas. Was then a suttantika one who knew precisely the Dialogues
by heart ? This was no doubt the earliest use of the term. But it
should be recollected that the Kath‡ vatthu, of about the same date,
uses the word suttanta also for passages from other parts of the
scriptures. However this may be, the terms <i>are conclusive proof of
the existence, some considerable time before the date of the
inscriptions, of a Buddhist literature called either a PiÒaka or the
PiÒakas, containing suttantas, and divided into Five Nik‡yas. </i>Fourthly,
on Asoka's Bhabra Edict he recommends to the communities of the
brethren and sisters of the Order, and to the lay disciples of either
sex, frequently to hear and to meditate upon seven selected passages.
These are as follows:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Of these passages Nos. 1 and 6 have not yet
been satisfactorily identified. The others may be regarded certain, for
the reasons I have set out elsewhere <a name="BM5"></a>[</font><a
 href="#n5">5</a><font face="Times_CSX+">] No. 2 also occurs in the
tenth book of the AÔguttara. It is clear that in Asoka's time there was
acknowledged to be an authoritative literature, probably a collection
of books, containing what was then believed to be the words of the
Buddha: and that it comprised passages already known by the titles
given in his Edict. Five out of the seven having been found in the
published portions of what we now call the PiÒakas, and in the portion
of them called the Five Nik‡yas, raises the presumption that when the
now unpublished portions are printed the other two will also, probably,
be identified. We have no evidence that any other Buddhist literature
was in existence at that date. What is perhaps still more important is
the point to which M. Senart <a name="BM6"></a>[</font><a href="#n6">6</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">] has called attention, and supported by numerous
details: the very clear analogy between the general tone and the
principal points of the moral teaching, on the one hand of the Asoka
edicts as a whole, and on the other of the Dhammapada, an anthology of
edifying verses taken, in great part, from the Five Nik‡yas, The
particular verses selected by M. Senart, as being especially
characteristic of Asoka's ideas, include extracts from each of the
Five. Fifthly, the four great Nik‡yas contain a number of stock
passages, which are constantly recurring, and in which some ethical
state is set out or described. Many of these are also found in the
prose passages [\q xv/] of the various books collected together in the
Fifth, the Khuddaka Nik‡ya. A number of them are found in each of the
thirteen Suttantas translated in this volume. There is great
probability that such passages already existed, as ethical sayings or
teachings, not only before the Nik‡yas were put together, but even
before the Suttantas were put together. There are also entire episodes,
containing not only ethical teaching, but names of persons and places
and accounts, of events, which are found, in identical terms, at two or
more places. These should be distinguished from the last. But they are
also probably older than our existing texts. Most of the parallel
passages, found in both P‡li and Sanskrit Buddhist texts, come under
one or other of these two divisions. Sixthly, the Sa¸yutta Nik‡ya (III,
13) quotes one Suttanta in the Dialogues by name; and both the Sa¸yutta
and the AÔguttara Nik‡yas quote, by name and chapter, certain poems now
found only in a particular chapter of the Sutta Nip‡ta. <i>This
Suttanta, and these poems, must therefore be older, and older in their
present arrangement, than the final settlement of, the text of these
two Nik‡yas. </i>Seventhly, several of the Dialogues purport to relate
conversations that took place between people, contemporaries with the
Buddha, but <i>after the Buddha's death. </i>One Sutta in the
AÔguttara is based on the death of the wife of MuıÛa, king of Magadha,
who began to reign about forty years after the death of the Buddha.
There is no reason at all to suspect an interpolation. It follows that,
not only the Sutta itself, but th<i>e date of the compilation of the
AÔguttara,</i> <i>must be subsequent to that event. </i>There is a
story in Peta Vatthu IV, 3, 1 about a King Pingalaka. Dhammap‡la, in
his commentary, informs us that this king, of whom nothing is otherwise
known, lived two hundred years after the Buddha. It follows that this
poem, and also the Peta Vatthu in which it is found, and also the
Vim‡na Vatthu, with which the Peta Vatthu really forms one whole work,
[\q xvi/] are later than the date of Pingalaka. And there is no reason
to believe that the commentator's date, although it is evidently only a
round number, is very far wrong. These books are evidently, from their
contents, the very latest compositions in all the Five Nik‡yas. There
is also included among the Thera G‡th‡, another book in the Fifth
Nik‡ya, verses said, by Dhammap‡la the commentator <a name="BM7"></a>[</font><a
 href="#n7">7</a><font face="Times_CSX+">], to have been composed by a <i>thera
</i>of the time of King Bindus‡ra, the father of Asoka, and to have
been added to the collection at the time of Asoka's Council. Eighthly,
several Sanskrit Buddhist texts have now been made accessible to
scholars. We know the real titles, given in the MSS. themselves, of
nearly 200 more. <a name="BM8"></a>[</font><a href="#n8">8</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">] And the catalogues in which the names occur give
us a considerable amount of detailed information as to their contents.
No one of them is a translation, or even a recession, of any one of the
twenty-seven canonical books. They are independent works; and seem to
bear. to the canonical books a relation similar, in many respects, to
that borne by the works of the Christian Fathers to the Bible. But
though they do not reproduce any complete texts, they contain numerous
verses, some whole poems, numerous sentences in prose, and some
complete episodes, found in the P‡li books. And about half a dozen
instances have been already found in which such passages are stated, or
inferred, to be from older texts, and are quoted as authorities. Most
fortunately we may hope, owing to the enlightened liberality of the
Academy of St. Petersburg, and the zeal and scholarship of Professor
d'Oldenbourg and his co-workers, to have a considerable number of
Buddhist Sanskrit Texts in the near future. And this is just what, in
the present state of our knowledge of the history of Buddhist writings,
is so great a <i>desideratum.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">[\q xvii/] It is possible to construct, in
accordance with these facts, a working hypothesis as to the history of
the literature. It is also possible to object that the evidence drawn
from the Milinda may be disregarded on the ground that there is nothing
to show that that work, excepting only the elaborate and stately
introduction and a few of the opening chapters, is not an impudent
forgery, and a late one, concocted by some Buddhist in Ceylon. So the
evidence drawn from the Kath‡ Vatthu may be disregarded on the ground
that there is nothing to show that that work is not an impudent
forgery, and a late one, concocted by some Buddhist in Ceylon. The
evidence drawn from the inscriptions may be put aside on the ground
that they do not explicitly state that the Suttantas and Nik‡yas to
which they refer, and the passages they mention, are the same as those
we now have. And the fact that the commentators point out, as peculiar,
that certain passages are nearly as late, and one whole book quite as
late, as Asoka, is no proof that the rest are older. It may even be
maintained that the P‡li PiÒakas are not therefore Indian books at all:
that they are all Ceylon forgeries, and should be rightly called `the
Southern Recension' or `the Si¸halese Canon.' Each of these
propositions, taken by itself, has the appearance of careful scruple.
And a healthy and reasonable scepticism is a valuable aid to historical
criticism. But can that be said of a scepticism that involves belief in
things far more incredible than those it rejects? In one breath we are
reminded of the scholastic dulness, the sectarian narrowness, the
literary incapacity, even the senile imbecility of the Ceylon
Buddhists. In the next we are asked to accept propositions implying
that they were capable of forging extensive documents so well, with
such historical accuracy, with so delicate a discrimination between
ideas current among themselves and those held centuries before, with so
great a literary skill in expressing the ancient views, that not only
did [\q xviii/] they deceive their contemporaries and opponents but
European scholars have not been able to point out a single discrepancy
in their work <a name="BM9"></a>[</font><a href="#n9">9</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">] . It is not unreasonable to hesitate in adopting a
scepticism which involves belief in so unique, and therefore so
incredible, a performance. The hesitation will seem the more reasonable
if we consider that to accept this literature for what it purports to
beﬁthat is, as North Indian <a name="BM10"></a>[</font><a href="#n10">10</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">] and for the most part pre-Asokanﬁnot only involves
no such absurdity, but is really just what one <i>would apriori </i>expect,
just what the history of similar literatures elsewhere would lead one
to suppose likely. The Buddha, like other Indian teachers of his time,
taught by conversation. A highly educated man (according to the
education current at the time), speaking constantly to men of similar
education, he followed the literary habit of his time by embodying his
doctrines in set phrases, sÂtras, on which he enlarged on different
occasions in different ways. In the absence of booksﬁfor though writing
was widely known, the lack of writing materials made any lengthy
written books impossible <a name="BM11"></a>[</font><a href="#n11">11</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">] such sÂtras were the recognised form of preserving
and communicating opinion. These particular ones were not in Sanskrit,
but in the ordinary conversational idiom of the day, that is to say, in
a sort of P‡li.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">[\q xix/] When the Buddha died these sayings
were collected together by his disciples into the Four Great Nik‡yas.
They cannot have reached their final form till about fifty years
afterwards. Other sayings and verses, most of them ascribed not to the
Buddha himself, but to the disciples, were put into a supplementary
Nik‡ya. We know of slight additions made to this Nik‡ya as late as the
time of Asoka. And the developed doctrine found in certain short books
in itﬁnotably in the Buddhava¸sa and Cariy‡ PiÒaka, and in the Petaﬁ
and Vim‡na-Vatthusﬁshow that these are later than the four old Nik‡yas.
For a generation or two the books as originally put together were
handed down by memory. And they were doubtless accompanied from the
first, as they, were being taught, by a running commentary. About 100
years after the Buddha's death there was a schism in the community.
Each of the two schools kept an arrangement of the canonﬁstill in P‡li
(or possibly some allied dialect). Sanskrit was not used for any
Buddhist works till long afterwards, and never used at all, so far as
we know, for the canonical books. Each of these two schools broke up,
in the following centuries, into others; and several of them had their
different arrangements of the canonical books, differing also no doubt
in minor details. Even as late as the first century after the Christian
Era, at the Council of Kanishka, these books, among many others then
extant, remained the only authorities <a name="BM12"></a>[</font><a
 href="#n12">12</a><font face="Times_CSX+">] . But they all, except
only our present P‡li Nik‡yas, have been lost in India. Of the stock
passages of ethical statement, and of early episodes, used in the
composition of them, and of the Suttas now extant, numerous fragments
have been preserved in the Hinay‡na Sanskrit texts. And some of the
Suttas, and of' the separate books, as used in other schools, are
represented in Chinese translations of the fourth and [\q xx/] fifth
centuries A. D. A careful and detailed comparison of these remains with
the P‡li Nik‡yas, after the method adopted in Windisch's `M‡ra und
Buddha,' cannot fail to throw much light on the history, and on the
method of composition, of the canonical books, which in style and
method, in language and contents and tone, bear all the marks of so
considerable an antiquity. Hofrath Dr. BÅhler, in the last work he
published, expressed the opinion that these books, as we have them in
the P‡li, are good evidence, certainty for the fifth, probably for the
sixth, century B. C. Subject to what has been said above, that will
probably become, more and more, the accepted opinion. And it is this
which gives to all they tell us, either directly or by implication, of
the social, political, and religious life of India, so great a value <a
 name="BM13"></a>[</font><a href="#n13">13</a><font face="Times_CSX+">]
.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">It is necessary, in spite of the limitations
of our space, to add a few words on the method followed in this
version. We talk of P‡li <i>books. </i>They are not books in the
modern sense. They are memorial sentences intended to be learnt by
heart ; and the whole style, and method of arrangement, is entirely
subordinated to this primary necessity. The leading ideas in any one of
our Suttantas, for instance, are expressed in short phrases not
intended to convey to a European reader the argument underlying them.
These are often repeated with slight variations. But neither the
repetitions nor the variationsﬁintroduced, and necessarily introduced,
as aids to memoryﬁhelp the modern reader very much. That of course was
not their object. For the object they were intended [\q xxi/] to serve
they are singularly well chosen, and aptly introduced. Other expedients
were adopted with a similar aim. Ideas were formulated, not in
logically co-ordinated sentences, but in numbered groups; and lists
were drawn up such as those found in the tract called the S„las, and in
the passer on the rejected forms of asceticism, both translated below.
These groups and lists, again, must have been accompanied from the
first by a running verbal commentary, given, in his own words, by the
teacher to his pupils. Without such a comment they are often quite
unintelligible, and always difficult. The inclusion of such <i>memoria
technica </i>makes the Four Nik‡yas strikingly different from modern
treatises on ethics or psychology. As they stand they were never
intended to be read. And a version in English, repeating all the
repetitions, rendering each item in the lists and groups as they stand,
by a single English word, without commentary, would quite fail to
convey the meaning, often intrinsically interesting, always
historically valuable, of these curious old documents. It is no doubt
partly the result of the burden of <i>such memoria technica, </i>but
partly also owing to the methods of exposition then current in North
India, that the leading <i>theses </i>of each Suttanta are not worked
out in the way in which we should expect to find similar theses worked
out now in Europe. A proposition or two or three, are put forward,
restated with slight additions or variations, and placed as it were in
contrast with the contrary proposition (often at first put forward by
the interlocutor). There the matter is usually left. There is no
elaborate logical argument. The choice is offered to the hearer; and,
of course, he usually accepts the proposition as maintained by the
Buddha. The statement of this is often so curt, enigmatic, and even
ﬁowing not seldom simply to our ignorance, as yet, of the exact force
of the technical terms usedﬁso [\q xxii/] ambiguous, that a knowledge
of the state of opinion on the particular point, in North India, at the
time, or a comparison of other Nik‡ya passages on the subject, is
necessary to remove the uncertainty. It would seem therefore most
desirable that a scholar attempting to render these Suttantas into a
European languageﬁevolved in the process of expressing a very
different, and often contradictory, set of conceptionsﬁshould give the
reasons of the faith that is in him. He should state <i>why </i>he
holds such and such an expression to be the least inappropriate
rendering: and quote parallel passages from other Nik‡ya texts in
support of his reasons. He should explain the real significance of the
thesis put forward by a statement of what, in his opinion, was the
point of view from which it was put forward, the stage of opinion into
which it fits, the current views it supports or controverts. In regard
to technical terms, for which there can be no exact equivalent, he
should give the P‡li. And in regard to the mnemonic lists and groups,
each word in which is usually a <i>crux, he </i>should give
cross-references, and wherever he ventures to differ from the Buddhist
explanations, as handed down in the schools, should state the fact, and
give his reasons. It is only by such discussions that we can hope to
make. progress in the interpretation of the history of Buddhist and
Indian thought. Bare versions are of no use to scholars, and even to
the general reader they can only convey loose, inadequate, and
inaccurate ideas. These considerations will, I trust, meet with the
approval of my fellow workers. Each scholar would of course, in
considering the limitations of his space, make a different choice as to
the points he regarded most pressing to dwell upon in his commentary,
as to the points he would leave to explain themselves. It may, I am
afraid, be considered that my choice in these respects has not been
happy, and especially that too many words or phrases have been left
without comment, where reasons were necessary. But I have, [\q xxiii/]
endeavoured, in the notes and introductions, to emphasise those points
on which further elucidation is desirable; and to raise some of the
most important of those historical questions which will have to be
settled before these Suttantas can finally be considered as having been
rightly understood.</font></p>

The blunder is on the part of the European professor, not of the Ceylon
paıÛits. No critical scholar will accept the proposition that because <i>the
