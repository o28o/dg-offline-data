<B>2 S&agrave;ma¤¤a-Ph&agrave;la Sutta</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION </B>[\q 056/] </P>
<P>THE first Dialogue deals with the most fundamental conceptions that lay at the root of the Buddha's doctrine, his Dharma, his ethical and philosophical view of life&THORN;the second puts forth his justification for the foundation of the Order, for the enunciation of the Vinaya, the practical rules of canon law by which life in the Order is regulated. The Rules themselves are not discussed. It is only certain ethical precepts that are referred to in so many words. The question is a larger and wider one than the desirability of any particular injunction. It is as to the advantage, as to the use, of having any Order at all.</P>
<P>King Aj&agrave;tasattu of Magadha, after pointing out the advantages derived from their occupations by a long list of ordinary people in the world, asks whether the members of the Order, who have given up the world, derive any corresponding advantage, visible in this life, from theirs. The answer is a list of such advantages, arranged in an ascending scale of importance, each one mentioned being said to be better and sweeter than the one just before described.</P>
<P>The list of ordinary occupations given in the question is interesting evidence, especially as compared with the later lists of a similar kind referred to in the notes, of social conditions in the Ganges valley at the time when this Dialogue was composed. And the introductory story, in which the king explains how he had put a similar question to the founders of six other orders, and gives the six replies he received, is interesting evidence of the views held by the authors of the Dialogue as to beliefs current at the time.</P>
<P>The replies are no less interesting from the fact, pointed out by the king, that they are not to the point. Each of the six teachers goes off into a general statement of his theory instead of answering the question put. But as the works, if any, of all these teachers save one&THORN;Niga&otilde;&ntilde;ha N&agrave;ta-putta have been irretrievably lost, the summary here given of their doctrines is of great importance as evidence of the sort of [\q 57/] speculation they favoured. The six paragraphs are short and obscure, and this is just what we should expect. As is the case with the accounts given by early Catholic writers of opinions they held to be heretical, the versions of these six sets of belief are neither adequate nor clear. But a number of other references to these six theories are found, as pointed out in the notes, both in the Buddhist and in the Jain records. And it would be premature to discuss our six paragraphs until the whole of the available evidence is made accessible to scholars. It is noteworthy that in at least two of these answers some of the expressions used seem to be in a Pr&agrave;krit differing in dialect from the P&agrave;li of the Pi&ntilde;akas. And these are not the only instances of the preservation in the Pi&ntilde;akas of ancient dialectical varieties.</P>
<P>The answer which the Buddha is represented to have given, in his turn, to the question raised by the king, takes (as is so often the case) the form of a counter-question. `The very man whom, under ordinary circumstances, you would treat as slave or servant&THORN;what treatment would you mete out to him after he had joined an Order?' The king confesses that he. would treat him as a person worthy of honour and respect. And neither in question nor answer is there any reference specially to the Buddhist Order. It is taken for granted, alike by the Buddha and the king, that any one who had devoted himself to the religious life, whatever the views or opinions he held, or the association he had joined, would, in accordance with the remarkable tolerance of that age and country, be treated with equal respect and courtesy. And the same note runs all through the Dialogue. The Buddha shows the advantages of the `life of a recluse,' not necessarily of a follower of his own. And most of what he says would apply as much to his strongest opponents as to the members of his own Order.</P>
<P>The following, in a constantly ascending order of merit, are the advantages, visible in this life, which he claims for such a recluse:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. The honour and respect shown to a member of a religious order.</P>
<P>2. The training in all those lower kinds of mere morality set out in the very ancient document called `The S&atilde;las.' The importance of this document has been discussed above, in the Introduction to the Brahmaj&agrave;la. The details of it may be summarised here as follows:</P><DIR>

</DIR>

<P>13. The realisation of the Four Truths, the destruction of the <I>&acirc;savas</I>, and attainment of Arahatship; Section 97, 98.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Now it is perfectly true that of these thirteen consecutive propositions, or groups of propositions, it is only the last, No. 13, which is exclusively Buddhist. But the things omitted, the union of the whole of those included into one system, the order in which the ideas are arranged, the way in which they are treated as so many steps of a ladder whose chief value depends on the fact that it leads up to the culminating point of Nirv&agrave;&otilde;a in Arahatship&THORN;all this is also distinctively Buddhist. And further, the whole statement, the details of it, the order of it, must have soaked very thoroughly into the minds of the early Buddhists. For we find the whole, or nearly the whole, of it repeated (with direct reference by name to our Sutta as the oldest and most complete enumeration of it) not only in all the subsequent dialogues translated in this volume, but also in many others.</P>
<P>In these repetitions the order is always the same, and the details (so far as they occur) are the same. But one or other of the thirteen groups is often omitted, and the application of those of them that remain is always different&THORN;that is to say,, they are enumerated in support, or in illustration, of a different proposition.</P>
<P>A comparison of some of these other applications of the list is full of suggestion as to its real meaning here.</P>
<P>In the Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha the point is as to caste. The Kshatriya caste is the most honourable, but wisdom and conduct are higher still. What then is the right conduct, what the right [\q 60/] wisdom? The conduct (cara&otilde;a) is all the above paragraphs from 2-9 inclusive; the wisdom (vijj&agrave;) is the rest, 10-13.</FONT> <A NAME="BM3"></A>[<A HREF="#n3">3</A>] </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>In the So&otilde;ada&otilde;&oacute;a the question is: What is the true Brahman?' After, by his usual Socratic method, leading So&otilde;ada&otilde;&oacute;a to acknowledge that the only two essential requisites are goodness and intelligence, these last are explained as above (2-9 and 10-13).</P>
<P>In the K&aring;&ntilde;adanta the question is as to the right sort of sacrifice. After rejecting animal sacrifice we have generosity (of various kinds, each better than the last), faith, training in the precepts, and 2-13, set forth as each of them a better sacrifice than the last.</P>
<P>In the J&agrave;liya the question is whether the soul is the same as, or is other than, the body. The answer is a counter question. Repeating our sections 2-13 (omitting 11 and 12) the Buddha asks, at the end of each subdivision, whether men who do that would be likely to trouble themselves as to speculations about the soul? And the answer being, of course, `No,' rejoins that neither does he.</P>
<P>In the Po&ntilde;&ntilde;hap&agrave;da the question is as to the way in which various recluses attain to mystic trance. The Buddha's answer is that it is by training; and the training should be first in morals (our groups 2 and 3) then in the things mentioned in our groups 4-9, and then in the Four Ar&aring;pa Vimokkhas. The Dialogue then takes up other questions, omitting our groups 10-13.</P>
<P>In the Keva&oacute;&oacute;ha the talk is on miracles, mystic powers. And the Buddha, disparaging all others, calls attention to our groups 2-13.</P>
<P>In the Lohicca the question is as to who is the right sort of teacher; and the answer is that it is the one whose pupil carries out our groups 2-13.</P>
<P>In the Tevijja the question is as to the way by which one can attain to union with God (<I>brahm&agrave;-sahavyat&agrave;</I>). The answer gives our groups 1-8, and then adds the four <I>brahma-vih&agrave;ras</I>.</P>
<P>In the shorter of the two Hatthipadopama Suttas [\q 61/] (No. 27 in the Majjhima), the question discussed between a Brahman and an ascetic is as to the ascendancy of the Buddha over the other teachers of the time. The Buddha himself giving afterwards the full reason, repeats our group 2 (omitting however clauses f to p inclusive <A NAME="BM4"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n4">4</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">), then repeats our groups 6, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) then omitting groups 10 and 11, quotes two only, the last two (omitting the first three) <A NAME="BM5"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n5">5</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">of the five Abhi¤¤&agrave;s in group 12, and concludes with group 13 in full.</P>
<P>In the Mah&agrave; Ta&otilde;h&agrave;-sa&iuml;khaya Sutta (NO. 38 in the Majjhima), we have the same sequence&THORN;our group 2 (omitting f to p), then 6, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. The rest is omitted.</P>
<P>In the next Sutta, the longer of the Assapuras, after a summary in different words of most of the contents of our group 2, we have our group 45 then two paragraphs not in our Sutta, then our groups 5, 7, 8, 9, and the last two only out of group 12, and then (as a climax) our group 13&THORN;all enumerated to show what is the true Brahman, the true sama&otilde;a.</P>
<P>Then again in the Sakulud&agrave;yi, NO. 79 of the Majjhima, it is declared to be not for the sake of realising happiness that recluses take up the celibate life in the Order under the Buddha, but for the sake of those matters set forth in our groups 2-9 inclusive <A NAME="BM6"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n6">6</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, of the two last of the Abhi¤¤&agrave;s, and above all for the sake of the attainment of Arahatship.</P>
<P>Besides the differences pointed out above between the Suttas preserved in the D&atilde;gha, and in the Majjhima, respectively&THORN;differences due, I think, solely to the difference in the subjects under discussion&THORN;there are also a few verbal differences, amounting to scarcely more than `various readings,' due, perhaps, to the divergent traditions of the D&atilde;gha bh&agrave;&otilde;ak&agrave; and the Majjhima-bh&agrave;&otilde;ak&agrave; (the students and repeaters of the two collections in which the Dialogues are handed down to us).</P>
<P>However this may be, it is clear that the sum and the sequence of the paragraphs in our Sutta is regarded as of [\q 62/] great importance, not as a statement of Buddhist ethics, or of Buddhist philosophy, or of the Buddhist religion, but as a statement of the advantages that may be looked for as the result of life in an Order. And further that the statement has to be slightly modified and shortened when the question is the narrower one of life in the particular community which we call the Buddhist Order.</P>
<P>The difference is interesting&THORN;in the scheme for the Buddhist Order the <I>¤&agrave;&otilde;a-dassana</I>, the power of projecting a mental image (apparently of oneself, which seems like the earliest germ of the modern Yoga ideas about, the astral body), the powers of <I>iddhi</I>, the power of hearing heavenly sounds (something like hearing the music of the spheres), and the power of knowing the thoughts of others, are all omitted.</P>
<P>In the abstract given above, I have called these last three, together with the power of calling to mind one's own, and other peoples', previous births, the Five Abhi¤¤&agrave;s, or Intuitions. And this is in accord with the passages on which Childers's article sub voce is based. But these powers are not so called either in our text, or in any other Dialogue yet published. The use of the word abhi¤¤&agrave; in this technical sense would seem therefore (to judge from the published texts) to be a sign of the later date of the book in which it occurs. <A NAME="BM7"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n7">7</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">In the oldest portions of the Pi&ntilde;akas the word is always used in the general sense of insight, and if any special limitation is hinted at, it is simply the insight of Arahatship that is emphasised (as in Dhammapada 423, which is a quotation from Itivuttaka, No. 99, and is quoted also at A&iuml;guttara I, 165 ). <A NAME="BM8"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n8">8</A>] </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>The Eightfold Path is not mentioned in our Sutta. This is not merely because it is not possible always to mention [\q 63/] everything. The Path does not come within the special advantages of life in the Order. To enter upon the Path to Arahatship, to walk along it, is not peculiar to members of the Order. A bhikshu might reach the goal either along that path, open also to laymen</FONT> <A NAME="BM9"></A>[<A HREF="#n9">9</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, or by the process set out in our Sutta. They are two quite distinct methods of training, of which our Sutta deals only with one</P>
<P>It is essential, in order to understand Buddhist ethics. to bear in mind that there are (and must be in such a system) several different lines along which both speculation and edifying teaching run. These are:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. The course of conduct laid down for the ordinary Buddhist layman, contained in the Gahapati-vaggas found in the various nik&agrave;yas</FONT> <A NAME="BM10"></A>[<A HREF="#n10">10</A>] </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>2. The rules as to the outward conduct of the members of the Order, laid down in the P&agrave;&ntilde;imokkha and in the Khandhakas</FONT> <A NAME="BM11"></A>[<A HREF="#n11">11</A>] </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>3. The system of self-training in higher things prescribed for members of the Order. Of this our present Sutta is a striking example.</P>
<P>4. The method of self-training laid down for those who have entered upon the Path to Arahatship. (The Four Truths, the Eightfold Path, and the &acirc;savas.)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>In the first of these Buddhism goes very little beyond the current ethics of the day. In the second a very great deal has been simply incorporated from the rules found expedient by previous recluses, both Brahman and non-Brahman, though there are numerous differences, both of the positive regulations included, and also of things deliberately omitted. Even the third, as we have seen, cannot be considered, except in a very limited sense, as exclusively Buddhist. It is in the fourth that the essential doctrines of Buddhism are to be found. All four have, no doubt, become welded together into a more or less consistent whole. But to understand the whole, the relation of its various parts has to be kept constantly in view.</P>
<P>This will explain an apparent contradiction. The last Sutta quoted, the Sakulud&agrave;yi, states that the aim of the religious or celibate life as led in the Buddha's Order, is the attainment, in order, of the various things set out in our Sutta (groups 2-9, 12 and 13).</P>
<P>[\q 64/] Now in other passages other things are stated to be the aim.</P>
<P>Thus in the Sa&uuml;yutta (IV, 51) the Buddha himself is represented as explaining that the celibate life (the brahmacariy&agrave;)</FONT> <A NAME="BM12"></A>[<A HREF="#n12">12</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">is led by his followers for the sake of the complete understanding of pain (<I>dukkha-pari¤¤&agrave;</I>). Further on in the same book (VI, 253 = V, 6, 27) this is three times repeated, with the suggestive addition that there is one way to this, to wit, the Noble Eightfold Path.</P>
<P>Again, in the A&iuml;guttara (IV, 7) the higher life is said to be for the sake of getting rid of, of cutting, through, seven Bonds which prevent one from attaining Arahatship. The argument on pp. 88, 99 (though the word <I>brahma-cariny&agrave;</I> does not occur) comes to much the same thing. And further on in the same book (IV, 272) the object is stated to be for the sake of getting rid of five particular sorts of envy.</P>
<P>N&agrave;gasena is therefore quite right when he says that the object of renouncing the world to live in the Order is for the sake of righteousness and peace</FONT> <A NAME="BM13"></A>[<A HREF="#n13">13</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">; and in. another place that it is to the end that sorrow may pass away</FONT> <A NAME="BM14"></A>[<A HREF="#n14">14</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">. All these explanations belong to the Path, not to the rules of the Order. They are not really inconsistent with the other aim that our Sutta sets out. And they are only additional proof, if such were needed, that it is no more possible to sum up in a single phrase (as some writers have tried to do) the aim of Buddhism, or the object of life in the Order, than it would be to sum up in a similar way the aim of Christianity, or the object for which men enter a Christian Order. The aims are necessarily as various as the character and circumstances of the various individuals who take them up. And N&agrave;gasena does not hesitate to add&THORN;and to add in speaking to a king&THORN;that some had joined the Order in terror at the tyranny of kings, some in fear of robbers, some because they were harassed by debt, and some perhaps merely to gain a livelihood.</P>
<P>This also would apply to other Orders both in India and elsewhere, and is quite consistent with our Sutta, which only purports to set forth the advantages the early Buddhists held to be the likely results of joining, from whatever motive, such an Order as their own.</P>

[THE FRUITS OF THE LIFE OF A RECLUSE</B>] <A NAME="BM15"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n15">15</A>] </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>[47] I. Thus have I heard. The Blessed One was once dwelling at R&agrave;jagaha in the Mango Grove of J&atilde;vaka the children's physician <A NAME="BM16"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n16">16</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, with a great company of the brethren, with twelve hundred and fifty of the brethren. Now at that time the king of Magadha, Aj&agrave;tasattu, the son of the Videha princess <A NAME="BM17"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n17">17</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, on the Uposatha day, held on the fifteenth, on Komudi (white [\q 66/] water-lily), the full moon day of the fourth month <A NAME="BM18"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n18">18</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, at night, when the moon was full, was seated on the upper terrace roof of his palace surrounded by his ministers. And the king, on that sacred day, gave utterance to a hymn of joy, saying:</P>
<P>`How pleasant, friends, is the moonlight night!</P>
<P>How beautiful, friends, is the moonlight night!</P>
<P>How lovely, friends, is the moonlight night!</P>
<P>How soothing, friends, is the moonlight night!</P>
<P>How grand a sign, friends, is the moonlight night!</P>
<P>`Who is the recluse or Brahman whom we may call upon tonight, who, when we call upon him, shall be able to satisfy our hearts? <A NAME="BM19"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n19">19</A>] </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>2. When he had thus spoken, a certain minister said to the king: `There is, Sire, P&aring;ra&otilde;a Kassapa, the head of an order, of a following, the teacher of a school, well-known and of repute as a sophist, revered by the people, a man of experience, who has long been a recluse, old and well stricken in years. Let your Majesty pay a visit to him. It may well be</FONT> <A NAME="BM20"></A>[<A HREF="#n20">20</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">that, on calling upon him, your heart, Sire, shall find peace.' But when he had thus spoken Aj&agrave;tasattu the king. kept silence.</P>
<P>3-7. Then other five ministers spake in the same terms of Makkhali of the cow-pen, [48] of Ajita of the garment of hair, of pakudha Kacc&agrave;yana, of Sa¤jaya of the Bela&ntilde;&ntilde;ha clan, and of the Niga&otilde;&ntilde;ha of the N&agrave;ta clan. And still, to each, Aj&agrave;tasattu the king kept silence.</P>
<P>[\q 67/] 8. [49] Now at that time J&atilde;vaka the physician was seated, in silence, not far from Aj&agrave;tasattu the king. And the king said to him: `But you, friend J&atilde;vaka, why do you say nothing?'</P>
<P>`The Blessed One, Sire, the Arahat, the all-awakened one, is now lodging in our Mango Grove, with a great company of the brethren, with twelve hundred and fifty brethren. And this is the good report that has been noised abroad as to Gotama the Blessed One: &szlig;An Arahat, fully awakened, is the exalted One, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, the teacher of gods and men, a blessed Buddha.&ucirc; Let your Majesty pay a visit to him. It may well be that, on calling upon him, your heart, Sire, shall find peace.'</P>
<P>`Then, friend J&atilde;vaka, have the riding-elephants made ready.'</P>
<P>9. `Very good, Sire!' said J&atilde;vaka the physician in assent to the words of the king. And he had five hundred she-elephants made ready, and the state elephant the king was wont to ride, and had word brought to the king: `The elephants, Sire, are caparisoned. Do now what seemeth to you meet.' Then the king had five hundred of his women mounted on the she-elephants, one on each; and himself mounted the state elephant; and he went forth, the attendants bearing torches, in royal pomp, from R&agrave;jagaha to J&atilde;vaka the physician's Mango Grove.</P>
<P>10. And the king, when close upon the Mango Grove, was seized with a sudden fear and consternation, and the hairs on his body stood erect. And anxious and excited, he said to J&atilde;vaka: [5o] `You are playing me no tricks, J&atilde;vaka? You are not deceiving me? You are not betraying me to my foes? How can it be that there should be no sound at all, not a sneeze nor a cough, in so large an assembly of the brethren, among twelve hundred and fifty of the brethren</P>
<P>`Fear not, O king I play no trick, neither deceive you; nor would I betray you to the foe. Go on, O king, [\q 68/] go straight on! There, in the pavilion hall, the lamps are burning.'</P>
<P>11. Then the king went on, on his elephant as far as the path was passable for elephants, and then on foot, to the door of the pavilion; and then said to J&atilde;vaka: `But where, J&atilde;vaka, is the Blessed One?'</P>
<P>`That is he, O king, sitting against the middle pillar, and facing the East, with the brethren around him.</P>
<P>12. Then the king went up, and stood respectfully on one side. And as he stood there and looked on the assembly, seated in perfect silence, calm as a clear lake, he broke out: `Would that my son, Ud&agrave;yi Bhadda, might have such calm as this assembly of the brethren now has! `</P>
<P>`Do your thoughts then go where love guides them?'</P>
<P>`I love the boy, and wish that he, Ud&agrave;yi Bhadda, might enjoy such calm as this assembly has.'</P>
<P>13. Then the king bowed to the Blessed One, and stretching forth his joined palms in salutation to the Order took his seat aside, [51] and said to the Blessed One: `I would fain question the Blessed One on a certain matter, if he give me opportunity to set forth the question.'</P>
<P>`Ask, O king, whatsoever you desire.'</P>
<P>14. `There are, Sir, a number of ordinary crafts mahouts, horsemen, charioteers, archers, standard bearers, camp marshalls, camp followers, high military officers of royal birth, military scouts <A NAME="BM21"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n21">21</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, men brave as elephants, champions, heroes, warriors in buckskin, home-born slaves, cooks, barbers, bath attendants, confectioners, garland-makers, washermen, weavers, basket-makers, potters, arithmeticians, accountants, and whatsoever others of like kind there may be. All [\q 69/] these enjoy, in this very world, the visible fruits of their craft. They maintain themselves, and their parents and children and friends, in happiness and comfort. They keep up gift, the object of which is gain on high, to recluses and Brahmans&THORN;gifts that lead to rebirth in heaven, that redound to happiness, and have bliss as their result. Can you, Sir, declare to me any such immediate fruit, visible in this very world, of the life of a recluse <A NAME="BM22"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n22">22</A>]?<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">'</P>
<P>15. `Do you admit to us, O king, that you have put the same question to other recluses or to Brahmans'</P>

<P>16. `Once I went to P&aring;ra&otilde;a Kassapa <A NAME="BM23"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n23">23</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">. And after exchanging with him the greetings and compliments of friendship and courtesy, I seated myself beside him, and put to him the same question as I have now put, Lord, to you.</P>
<P>17. `Then P&aring;ra&otilde;a Kassapa said to me: &szlig;To him who acts, O king, or causes another to act, to him who mutilates or causes another to mutilate, to him who punishes or causes another to punish, to him who causes grief or torment, to him who trembles or causes others to tremble, to him who kills a living creature, who takes what is not given, who breaks into houses, who commits dacoity, or robbery, or highway robbery, or adultery, or who speaks lies, to him thus acting there is no guilt. If with a discus with an edge sharp as [\q 70/] a razor he should make all the living creatures on the earth one heap, one mass, of flesh, there would be no guilt thence resulting, no increase of guilt would ensue. Were he to go along the south bank of the Ganges striking and slaying, mutilating and having men mutilated, oppressing and having men oppressed, there would be no guilt thence resulting, no increase of guilt would ensue. Were he to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving alms, and ordering gifts to be given, offering sacrifices or causing them to be offered, there would be no merit thence resulting no increase of merit. [53] In generosity, in self-mastery, in control of the senses, in speaking truth there is neither merit, nor increase of merit.&ucirc; Thus, Lord, did P&aring;ra&otilde;a Kassapa, when asked what was the immediate advantage in the life of a recluse, expound his theory of non-action, <A NAME="BM24"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n24">24</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">just, Lord, as if a man, when asked what a mango was, should explain what a bread fruit is, just so did P&aring;ra&otilde;a Kassapa, when asked what was the fruit, in this present state of being, of the life of a recluse, expound his theory of non-action. Then, Lord, it occurred to me: &szlig;How should such a one as I think of giving dissatisfaction to any recluse or Brahman in my realm?&ucirc; So I neither applauded nor blamed what he said, and though dissatisfied I gave utterance to no expression of dissatisfaction, and neither accepting nor rejecting that answer of his, I arose from my seat, and departed thence.</P>

There is no cause, either proximate or remote, for the rectitude of beings; they become pure without reason and without cause. The attainment of any given condition, of any character, does not depend either on one's own acts, or on the acts of another, or on human effort.

<P>&szlig;There is no such thing, O king, as alms or sacrifice or offering. There is neither fruit nor result of good or evil deeds. There is no such thing as this world or the next.

<P>`&szlig;A human being is built up of the four elements.

<P>`Thus, Lord, did Ajita of the garment of hair, when asked what was the immediate advantage in the life of a recluse, expound his theory of annihilation.</P>
<P>[56] 26. `When, one day, I had thus asked Pakudha Kacc&agrave;yana, he said, &szlig;The following seven things, O king, are neither made nor commanded to be made, neither created nor caused to be created, they are barren (so that nothing is produced out of them), stedfast as a mountain peak, as a pillar firmly fixed.

The four elements&THORN;earth, water, fire, and air&THORN;and case, and pain, and the soul as a. seventh. So there is neither slayer nor causer of slaying, hearer or speaker, knower or explainer.

<P>`Thus, Lord, did Pakudha Kacc&agrave;yana, when asked what was the immediate advantage in the life of a recluse, expound the matter by expounding something else.</P>
<P>[57] 28. `When, one day, I had thus asked the Niga&otilde;&ntilde;ha of the N&agrave;ta clan, he said: &szlig;A Niga&otilde;&ntilde;ha, O king (a man free from bonds), is restrained with a fourfold self-restraint.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>34. And now, Lord, I put the same question to the Blessed One. Can you show me any immediate fruit, in this world, of the life of a recluse, such as those who follow each of the occupations I have mentioned are, each of them, able to show?'</P>
<P>`I can, O king. And to that end I would fain put a question to you. Answer it as you may think most fit.</P>
<P>[60] 35. `Now what do you think, O king. Suppose among the people of your household there were a slave who does work for you, rises up in the morning before you do and retires earlier to rest, who is keen to carry out your pleasure, anxious to make himself agreeable in what he does and says, a man who watches your every look. Suppose he should think, &szlig;Strange is it and wonderful, this issue of meritorious deeds, this result of merit! Here is this king of Magadha, Aj&agrave;tasattu, the son of the Videha princess&THORN;he is a man, and so am I. But the king lives in the full enjoyment and possession of the five pleasures of sense&THORN;a very god, methinks&THORN;and here am I a slave, working for him, rising before him and retiring earlier to rest, keen to carry out his pleasure, anxious to make myself agreeable in deed and word, watching his very looks. Would that I were like him, that I too might earn merit. Why should not I have my hair and beard shaved off, [\q 77/] and don the yellow robes, and going forth from the household state, renounce the world?&ucirc; And suppose, after a time, he should do so. And having been admitted into an Order, should dwell restrained in act and word and thought. content with mere food and shelter, delighting in solitude. And suppose your people should tell you of this, saying: &szlig;If it please your majesty, do you know that such a one, formerly your slave, who worked for you, and so on (all as before) has now donned the yellow robes, and has been admitted into an Order, and dwells restrained, content with mere food and shelter, delighting in solitude?&ucirc; Would you then say, &szlig;Let the man come back; let him become a slave again, and work for me&ucirc;?'</P>
<P>36. `Nay, Lord, rather should we greet him with reverence [61] , and rise up from our seat out of deference towards him, and press him to be seated. And we should have robes and a bowl, and a lodging place, and medicine for the sick&THORN;all the requisites of a recluse&THORN;made ready, and beg him to accept of them. And we should order watch and ward and guard to be kept for him according to the law.'</P>
<P>`But what do you think, O king. That being so, is there, or is there not, some fruit, visible in this world, of the life of a recluse?'</P>
<P>`Certainly, Lord, that is so.'</P>
<P>`This then, O king, is the first kind of the fruit, visible in this world, which I maintained to arise from the life of a recluse.'</P>
<P>37. `Can you, Lord, show me any other fruit, visible in this world, of the life of a recluse?'</P>
<P>`I can, O king. And to that end I would fain put a question, &amp;c. [as before, to the end of Section 36, the case now put being that of a free man who cultivates his land, a householder, who pays taxes and thus increases the king's wealth, but gives up his little property and his position in his clan, and enters an Order.] '</P>
<P>[62] 39. `Can you, Lord, show me any other fruit, visible in this world, of the life of a recluse, a fruit higher and sweeter than these?&ucirc;</P>
<P>[\q 78/] `I can, O king. Give ear therefore, O king, and give good heed, and I will speak.</P>
<P>40. `Suppose, O king, there appears in the world one who has won the truth, an Arahat, a fully awakened one, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, who knows all worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher for gods and men, a Blessed One, a Buddha. He, by himself, thoroughly knows and sees, as it were, face to face this universe&THORN;including the worlds above of the gods, the Brahmas, and the M&agrave;ras, and the world below with its recluses and Brahmans, its princes and peoples&THORN;and having known it, he makes his knowledge known to others. The truth, lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation, doth he proclaim, both in the spirit and in the letter, the higher life doth he make known, in all its fullness and in all its purity. <A NAME="BM39"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n39">39</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>41. `A householder <A NAME="BM40"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n40">40</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">or one of his children, or a man of inferior birth in any class listens to that truth; and on hearing it he has faith in the Tath&agrave;gata (the one who has found the truth); and when he is possessed of that faith, he considers thus within himself:</P>
<P>Full of hindrances is household life, a path for the dust of passion. Free as the air is the life of him who has renounced all worldly things. How difficult is it for the man who dwells at home to live the higher life in all its fullness, in all its purity, in all its bright perfection! Let me then cut off my hair and beard, let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes, and let me go forth from the household life into the homeless state.&ucirc;</P>
<P>`Then, before long, forsaking his portion of wealth, be it great or small, forsaking his circle of relatives, be they many or be they few, he cuts off his hair and beard, he clothes himself in the orange-coloured robes, [\q 79/] and he goes forth from the household life into the homeless state.</P>
<P>42. `When he has thus become a recluse he lives self-restrained by that restraint that should be binding on a recluse <A NAME="BM41"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n41">41</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">. Uprightness is his delight, and he sees danger in the least of those things he should avoid. He adopts, and trains himself in, the precepts. He encompasses himself with good deeds in act and word. Pure are his means of livelihood, good is his conduct, guarded the door of his senses. Mindful and self-possessed he is altogether happy.</P>
<P>43. `And how, O king, is his conduct good?</P>
<P>`In this, O king, that the Bhikshu, putting away the killing of living things, holds aloof from the destruction of life. The cudgel and the sword he has laid aside, and ashamed of roughness, and full of mercy, he dwells compassionate and kind to all creatures that have life.</P>
<P>`This is part of the goodness that he has.</P>
<P>[Here follow the whole of the S&atilde;las (the paragraphs on minor morality), in the words already translated above in the Brahma-j&agrave;la Sutta, Section 8 to 27. Only for `Gotama the recluse' one should read `the Bhikshu'; and alter in each case the words of the refrain accordingly.] </P>
<P>[69] 63. , And then that Bhikshu, O king, being thus master of the minor moralities, sees no danger from any side, that is, so far as concerns his self-restraint in conduct. Just, O king, as a sovereign, duly crowned, whose enemies have been beaten down, sees no danger from any side; [70] that is, so far as enemies are concerned, so is the Bhikshu confident. And endowed with this body of morals, so worthy of honour, he experiences, within himself, a sense of ease without alloy. Thus is it, O king, that the Bhikshu becomes righteous.</P>
<P>64. `And how, O king, is the Bhikshu guarded as to the doors of his senses <A NAME="BM42"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n42">42</A>]?</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>[\q 80/] `When, O king, he sees an object with his eye he is not entranced in the general appearance or the details of it <A NAME="BM43"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n43">43</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">. He sets himself to restrain that which might give occasion for evil states, covetousness and dejection, to flow in over him so long as he dwells unrestrained as to his sense of sight. He keeps watch upon his faculty of sight, and he attains to mastery over it. And so, in like manner, when he hears a sound with his ear, or smells an odour with his nose, or tastes a flavour with his tongue, or feels a touch with his body, or when he cognises a phenomenon with his mind he is not entranced in the general appearance or the details of it. He sets himself to restrain that which might give occasion for evil states, covetousness and dejection, to flow in over him so long as he dwells unrestrained as to his mental (representative) faculty. He keeps watch upon his representative faculty, and he attains to mastery over it.

<P>65. `And how, O king, is the Bhikshu mindful and self-possessed?</P>
<P>`In this matter, O king, the Bhikshu in going forth or in coming back keeps clearly before his mind's eye (all that is wrapt up therein&THORN;the immediate object of [\q 81/] the act itself, its ethical significance, whether or not it is conducive to the high aim set before him, and the real facts underlying the mere phenomenon of the outward act). And so also in looking forward, or in looking round; in stretching forth his arm, or in drawing it in again; in eating or drinking, in masticating or swallowing, in obeying the calls of nature, in going or standing or sitting, in sleeping or waking, in speaking or in being still, he keeps himself aware of all it really means <A NAME="BM45"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n45">45</A>] <FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">.
