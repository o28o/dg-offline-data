<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P><A NAME="n1"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#BM1">1</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] These things of the present, see them with insight as they arise (<I>paccuppanna¤ ca yo dhamma&uuml; tattha tattha vipassati</I>). `The things that constanatly arise in the present are matter, that is whatever matters at one or the other of the doors of mental contact, such as sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and ideas. Then the feelings that arise on account of these sights etc. and the perceptions and determinations and consciousesses that follow. These things have to be seen with right insight and the self view should be destroyed.</P>

The army of Death consists of all the defiling things that arise in the mind. They are sensuality, aversion, hunger, thirst, craving, sloth and tor por, fear, doubts, besmearing, stubornness. Gain, fame and honour obtained unrighteously, praising oneself and disparaging others. This is the army of Death.</P>
