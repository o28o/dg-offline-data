</I>(151) The Purity of Alms Food</P>
</B><P>I Heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. Then venerable S&agrave;riputta getting up from his seclusion in the evening approached the Blessed One, worshipped, and sat on a side. The Blessed One said to venerable S&agrave;riputta. `S&agrave;riputta, your mental faculties are bright, skin colour is pure, in which abiding, do you spend your time mostly?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, I spend my time mostly in voidance.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;It's good S&agrave;riputta, you abide mostly in the abiding of Great Beings. S&agrave;riputta, a bhikkhu who desires to abide in voidance most of the time should reflect. When going for alms along a certain path, or in a certain region, or returning along a certain path, does interest, or greed, or anger, or delusion, or aversion, arise in my mind on account of forms cognizable by eye consciousness?</P>
<P>When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, when going for alms along a certain path, or in a certain region, or returning along a certain path, interest, or greed, or anger, or delusion, or aversion, arises in my mind on account of forms cognizable by eye consciousness. Then he should arouse effort to dispel those evil thoughts.</P>

Then he should abide joyful and happy training in those thoughts day and night.</P>

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>[1] Is my calm and insight developed? (<I>Bh&agrave;vit&agrave; nu kho me samatho ca vipassan&agrave; c&agrave;ti?</I>) To develop calm is to pacify the mind by throwing out evil things of demerit in the mind and not leaving any room for them to rise again. To do this there are various methods to adopt and various signs to develop. The most suitable sign should be adopted at the relevant time. A few of them are reflecting in and out breaths, being aware of one's movements, being mindful of one's feelings, being mindful of one's mental states and thoughts etc. To develop insight is to be aware of the fact that everything is impermanent. That whatever impermanent thing, is unpleasant. And whatever impermanent, unpleasant thing lacks self.</P>
<P>[2] Is science and release realized by me? (<I>Sacchikat&agrave; nu kho me vijj&agrave; ca vimutti c&agrave;ti?</I>) Science is the knowledge of the Truth of unpleasantness, the truth of its arising, the truth of its cessation and the truth of the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. When this is realized the mind is released.</P>
