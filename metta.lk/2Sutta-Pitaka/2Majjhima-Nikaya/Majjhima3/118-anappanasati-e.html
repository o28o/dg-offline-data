</font></i><font face="Times_CSX+">(118) The Discourse On In and Out
Breathing</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">I heard thus. At one time the
Blessed One lived in the Pubba monastery in the palace of
Mig&agrave;ra's mother, with the thoroughly learned elder
disciples, such as venerables S&agrave;riputta,
Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na, Mah&agrave;kassapa,
Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana,
Mah&agrave;ko&ntilde;&ntilde;hita, Mah&agrave;kappina,
Mah&agrave;cunda, Anuruddha, Revata, &acirc;nanda and other
learned elder disciples. At that time the elder bhikkhus were advising
and instructing the novices. A certain elder bhikkhu advised ten
novices, another twenty novices, another thirty and yet another forty
novices. The novices too advised and instructed by the elder bhikkhus
attained distinctive levels not attained before. On that full moon
night the Blessed One was seated outside in the moonlight attended by
the Community of bhikkhus</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">The Blessed One observed the silent
Community of bhikkhus and addessed them `Bhikkhus, I'm happy and
convinced with this mode of progress. Therefore bhikkhus arouse much
effort to attain the not attained, to realize the not realized, as I
would be leaving S&agrave;vatthi on the full moon day of the fourth
month of the rains. `. The bhikkhus who had come from the states heard
these words and they came to see the Blessed One. The elder bhikkhus
hearing these words were very pleased and advised and instructed the
novices. A certain elder bhikkhu advised ten novices, another twenty
novices, another thirty and yet another forty novices. The novices too
advised and instructed by the elder bhikkhus attained distinctive
levels not attained before. On that full moon night of the fourth month
of the rains the Blessed One was seated outside, in the moonlight
attended by the Community of bhikkhus</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Then the Blessed One observed the
silent Community of bhikkhus and addressed them. Bhikkhus, this
gatherig is without idle talk, without empty talk, established in the
pure essence. Such a gathering is worthy of honour, worthy of
hospitality, worthy of offerings and reverential salutation, and it
becomes an incomparable field of merit to the worldling. Giving a
little to such a gathering brings much results, giving much brings much
more. The sight of such a gathering is rare in the worldIt is suitable
to go a long distance to see such a gathering with provisions for the
journey. In this gathering there are worthy ones, desires destroyed,
lived the holy life, done what should be done, dismissed the weight,
come to the highest good, destroyed the bond `to be' and rightly
knowing released. In this gathering there are bhikkhus who have
destroyed the five lower bonds of the sensual world and are born
spontaneously, not to proceed but to extinguish in that same birthIn
this gathering there are bhikkhus, who have destroyed three bonds and
dwindling greed, hate and delusion, would come to this world once more
and make an end of unpleasantness. In this gathering there are
bhikkhus, who have destroyed three bonds and have entered the stream of
the Teaching, not falling from there, are sure of enlightenment. In
this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developing the four
establishments of mindfulness. In this gathering there are bhikkhus,
yoked to developing the four right endeavours. In this gathering there
are bhikkhus, yoked to developing the four ways of making
determinations. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to
developing the five mental faculties. In this gathering there are
bhikkhus, yoked to developing the five powers. In this gathering there
are bhikkhus, yoked to developing the seven enlightenment factors. In
this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developing the Noble
eightfold pathIn this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to developing
Loving kindnessIn this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to
developing Compassion. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked to
developing Intrinsic joy. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked
to developing Equanimity. In this gathering there are bhikkhus, yoked
to developing Loathsomeness. In this gathering there are bhikkhus,
yoked to developing the perception of impermanence. In this gathering
there are bhikkhus, yoked to developing Mindfulness of in and out
breathing. Bhikkhus, in and out breathing developed and made much
brings much results and great results. When it is developed and made
much, the four establishments of mindfulness get completed. When the
the four establishments of mindfulness are developed and made much the
seven enlightenment factors get completed When the seven enlightenment
factors are developed and made much the knowledge of release gets
completed. Bhikkhus, how is, in and out breathing developed and made
much?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">How does it bring much results and
great results? The bhikkhu, gone to the forest, or to the root of a
tree, or to an empty house, sits legs crossed, the body straight, and
mindfulness established in front. Mindfully he breathes in or breathes
out. Breathing in long knows, I breathe in long. Breathing out long
knows, I breathe out long. Breathing in short knows, I breathe in

is zealous to be mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and
displeasure for the world. Bhikkhus, I say in breaths and out breaths
are a special feature in the body. Therefore bhikkhus, at such times,
the bhikkhu abides reflecting the body in the body zealous to be

Bhikkhus, I say in breaths and out breaths are a special feature of
feelings, when they are carefully attended to. Therefore bhikkhus, at
such times, the bhikkhu abides reflecting feelings in feelings zealous
to be mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the
world. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu trains experiencing the mental state,
I breathe in and out. Trains with a rejoicing mind I breathe in and

released mind. I breathe in and out, at such times he reflects the
mental states in the mind. At such times he is zealous to be mindful
and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world.
Bhikkhus, I do not declare in and out breathing to the forgetful
careless, one. Therefore bhikkhus, at such times, the bhikkhu abides
reflecting the mental states in the mind zealous to be mindful and
aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure for the world.</font></p>

he is zealous to be mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and

whatever covetousness and displeasure in the world and masters it.
Therefore bhikkhus, at such times, the bhikkhu abides reflecting
thoughts in the Teaching, zealous to be mindful and aware to dispel
covetousness and displeasure for the world. Bhikkhus, when developed
and made much in this manner the four foundations of mindfulness get
completed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">The four establishments of
mindfulness developed and made much in which manner, do the seven
enlightenment factors get completed? Bhikkhus, at the time the bhikkhu
abides reflecting the body in the body mindful and aware to dispel
covetousness and displeasure for the world, his mindfulness is
established without forgetfulness. At a time the bhikkhu's mindfulness
is established, the enlightenment factor mindfulness is established to
the bhikkhu, at that time the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor
mindfulness. and completes it. He abides with those thoughts mindfully
examining them, wisely searchingfor the solution. Bhikkhus, at a time
the bhikku abides thus, mindfullyexamining the Teaching wisely, to
search for the solution, he develops the enlightenment factor the
investigation of the Teaching, and completes it. When those thoughts
are wisely examined for a direct solution with aroused effort the
enlightenment factor effort, is establishedto the bhikkhu, at that time
the bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor effort and completes it.
With the aroused effort arises immaterial joy. When immaterial joy
arises the bhikkhu is established in the enlightenment factor joy and
it gets completed. When the mind is joyful the body is appeased, so too
the mind. When the mind and body are appeased, the enlightenment factor
appeasement gets established in the bhikkhu, with development it gets
completed. When the body is appeased the pleasant mind concentrates. At
that time the bhikkhu is established in the enlightenment factor
