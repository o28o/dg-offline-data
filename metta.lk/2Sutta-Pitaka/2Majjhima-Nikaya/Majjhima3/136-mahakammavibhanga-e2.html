<p></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b>
(by Bhikkhu Khantipalo)<br>
This celebrated sutta shows some of the complexities of kamma and its
results. Beginning with a strange view expressed by a confused wanderer
and a confused answer given by a bhikkhu, the Buddha then gives his
Great Exposition of Kamma which is based upon four "types" of people: </p>
<blockquote>the evil-doer who goes
to hell (or some other low state of birth),<br>
the evil-doer who goes to heaven,<br>
the good man who goes to heaven, and<br>
the good man who goes to hell (or other low birth). </blockquote>
<p>The Buddha then shows how wrong
views can arise from only partial understanding of truth. One can see
the stages of this: (1) a mystic "sees" in vision an evil-doer
suffering in hell, (2) this confirms what he had heard about moral
causality, (3) so he says, "evil-doers always go to hell," and (4)
dogma hardens and becomes rigid when he says (with the dogmatists of
all ages and places), "Only this is true; anything else is wrong." The
stages of this process are repeated for each of the four "persons,"
after which the Buddha proceeds to analyze these views grounded in
partial experience and points out which portions are true (because
verifiable by trial and experience) and which are dogmatic
superstructure which is unjustified. Finally, the Buddha explains his
Great Exposition of Kamma in which he shows that notions of
invariability like "the evildoer goes to hell" are much too simple. The
minds of people are complex and they make many different kinds of kamma
even in one lifetime, some of which may influence the last moment when
kamma is made before death, which in turn is the basis for the next
life. </p>

<hr>
<p></p>
<p>1. Thus have I heard. On one
occasion the Blessed One was living at <a name="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a>,
in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Feeding Place. Now on that occasion
the <a name="samiddhi">venerable
Samiddhi</a> was living in a forest
hut. </p>
<p>Then the wanderer <a name="potaliputta">Potaliputta</a>,
walking and wandering for exercise, came to the venerable Samiddhi and
exchanged greetings with him, and when the courteous and amiable talk
was finished, he sat down at one side. When he had done so, he said to
the venerable Samiddhi: </p>
<p>2. "I heard and learned this,
friend Samiddhi, from the monk Gotama's lips: 'Bodily kammas are vain,
verbal kammas are vain, only mental kammas are true.' But there is
actually that attainment having entered upon which nothing (of result
of kammas) is felt at all." </p>
<p>"Not so, friend Potaliputta, do
not say thus, do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is not good to
misrepresent the Blessed One; the Blessed One would not say so: 'Bodily
kammas are vain, verbal kammas are vain, only mental kammas are true.'
And there is actually that attainment having entered upon which nothing
(of result of kammas) is felt at all." </p>
<p>"How long is it since you went
forth, friend Samiddhi?" </p>
<p>"Not long, friend, three
years." </p>
<p>"There now, what shall we say
to the elder bhikkhus, when the young bhikkhu fancies the Master is to
be defended thus? After doing intentional kamma, friend Samiddhi, by
way of body, speech or mind, what does one feel (of its result)?" </p>
<p>"After doing an intentional
kamma, friend Potaliputta, by way of body, speech or mind, one feels
suffering (as its result)." </p>
<p>Then neither agreeing nor
disagreeing with the words of the venerable Samiddhi, the wanderer
Potaliputta got up from his seat and went away. </p>
<p>3. Soon after the wanderer
Potaliputta had gone, the venerable Samiddhi went to the <a
 name="ananda">venerable &acirc;nanda</a>
and exchanged greetings with him, and when the courteous and amiable
talk was finished, he sat down at one side. When he had done so, he
told the venerable &acirc;nanda all his conversation with the
wanderer Potaliputta. </p>
<p>When this was said, the
venerable &acirc;nanda told him: "Friend Samiddhi, this
conversation should be told to the Blessed One. Come, let us go to the
Blessed One, and having done so, let us tell him about this. As he
answers, so we shall bear it in mind." </p>
<p>"Even so, friend," the
venerable Samiddhi replied. </p>
<p>Then they went together to the
Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side.
When they had done so, the venerable &acirc;nanda told the Blessed
One all the venerable Samiddhi's conversation with the wanderer
Potaliputta. </p>
<p>4. When this was said, the
Blessed One told the venerable &acirc;nanda: </p>
<p>"I do not even know the
wanderer by sight, &acirc;nanda. How could there have been such a
conversation? The wanderer Potaliputta's question ought to have been
answered after analyzing it, but this misguided man Samiddhi answered
it without qualification. <a name="BM1">[</a><a href="#n1">1</a>] </p>
<p>When this was said, the <a name="udayin">venerable Udayin</a>
said to the Blessed One: "'But, venerable sir, supposing when the
venerable Samiddhi spoke, he was referring to this, namely, 'Whatever
is felt is suffering.'" <a name="BM2">[</a><a href="#n2">2</a>] </p>
<p>5. Then the Blessed One
addressed the venerable &acirc;nanda: "See, &acirc;nanda, how
this misguided man Udayin interferes. I knew, &acirc;nanda, that
this misguided man Udayin would unreasonably interfere now. To begin
with it was the three kinds of feeling that were asked about by the
wanderer Potaliputta. If, when this misguided man Samiddhi was asked,
he had answered the wanderer Potaliputta thus: 'After doing an
intentional kamma by way of body, speech and mind (whose result is) to
be felt as pleasure, he feels pleasure; after doing an intentional
kamma by way of body, speech and mind (whose result is) to be felt as
pain, he feels pain; after doing an intentional kamma by way of body,
speech and mind (whose result is) to be felt as
neither-pain-nor-pleasure, he feels neither-pain-nor-pleasure' -- by
answering him thus, &acirc;nanda, the misguided man Samiddhi would
have given the wanderer Potaliputta the right answer. Besides,
&acirc;nanda, who are the foolish thoughtless wanderers of other
sects that they will understand the Tathagata's Great Exposition of
Kamma? (But) if you, &acirc;nanda, would listen to the Tathagata
expounding the Great Exposition of Kamma (you might understand it). <a
 name="BM3">[</a><a href="#n3">3</a>] </p>
<p>"This is the time, Blessed One,
this is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One to expound the Great
Exposition of Kamma. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus
will bear it in mind." </p>
<p>"Then listen, &acirc;nanda,
and heed well what I shall say." </p>
<p>"Even so, venerable sir," the
venerable &acirc;nanda replied. The Blessed One said this: </p>
<p>6. "&acirc;nanda, there are
four kinds of persons existing in the world. What four? </p>
<p>(i) "<a name="BM10unwholesomes">Here some</a>

Devadatta, for instance, who persuaded prince Aj&agrave;tasattu to

murder the Buddha and once succeeded in wounding him, and caused a
schism in the Sangha; the last two actions are certain to lead to birth
in hell. [<a href="#BM7">Go

This series of three phrases appears to mean: <i>earlier,</i>
either earlier in life before he undertook either the wholesome or
unwholesome courses of kamma, or in some previous life; <i>later,</i>
later in that very life, for even if a person does much evil kamma,
usually he will also make some good kamma occasionally; <i>wrong
view...time of his death,</i> this
kind of wrong view will be of the type, "there is no kamma, no results
of kamma, no evil, no results of evil," and so on. The next birth
actually depends on the object of the last moments of a dying person's
consciousness. At that time one should recollect all one's good kamma:
generosity, loving-kindness, compassion, pure precepts and so on. Evil
should not be thought of then though heavy evil kamma done previously
may force itself into the mind and make recollection of one's
generosity and virtue in keeping the precepts difficult or impossible. [<a

</p>
<p><b><a name="n9">9</a>.</b>
A good example of this is the story of "Coppertooth," the public
executioner who, after a career of murder as a bandit, then as the
killer of his own bandit comrades and subsequently executioner of all
criminals for fifty years, was taught by venerable S&agrave;riputta
Thera and his mind eased of the heavy weight of evil kamma so that he
attained heavenly rebirth. See Dhammapada Commentary, ii, 203-209. [<a

</p>
<p><b><a name="n10">10</a>.</b>
Though such a person attained a heavenly rebirth the evil kamma made
will still mature sooner or later; he has not escaped its results. [<a

King Pasenadi of Kosala, for instance. [<a href="#BM11">Go back</a>]

This was what happened to Queen Mallika, wife of King Pasenadi, who had
led a good life, generous, keeping the Five Precepts, and the Eight
Precepts on Uposatha days and so on, but once she did evil, having
sexual relations with a dog. This unconfessed evil weighed heavily on
her mind and she remembered it when dying. As a result she spent seven
days in hell. Her power of goodness from the doing of many good kammas
then gave her rebirth in a heavenly world. See Dhammapada Commentary,
iii, 119-123. [<a href="#BM12">Go
back</a>] </p>
<p><b><a name="n13">13</a>.</b>
Though this virtuous and good person has obtained a low rebirth through
the power of previously done evil kamma, still the good kamma made by
him will mature sooner or later, when it gets a chance. [<a href="#BM13">Go

<p><b><a name="n14">14</a>.</b>
This final terse paragraph may have been clear to the venerable
&acirc;nanda Thera, or he may have asked for an explanation, as we
require and find in the Commentary, which says: </p>
<blockquote><b>i.</b>A
strong unwholesome kamma (incapable of good result), the result of
which will come before the results of weaker unwholesome kammas. </blockquote>
<blockquote><b>ii.</b>
Wholesome kamma (which appears capable of good result) is followed by
unwholesome death-proximate kamma which makes the former incapable of
good result immediately. </blockquote>
<blockquote><b>iii.</b>A
strong wholesome kamma will mature even before much accumulated
unwholesome kamma. </blockquote>
<blockquote><b>iv.</b>Unwholesome
kamma (which appears incapable of good result) is followed by wholesome
death-proximate kamma which will mature first and is capable of good
results. </blockquote>
