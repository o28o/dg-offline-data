(115) The Discourse on Many Elements</P>
</B><P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&iuml;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. `Whatever fears, misfortunes and dangers arise, they all arise from the foolish not from the wise. Thus bhikkhus, the foolish are with fears, m&atilde;sfortunes and dangers. Therefore bhikkhus, to become wise inquirers, you should train thus.</P>
<P>When this was said, venerable &acirc;nanda asked the Blessed One, `Venerable sir, saying it rightly how does the wise bhikkhu become an inquirer?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, when the bhikkhu becomes clever, in the elements, in the spheres, in dependent arising and in the possible and impossible, he becomes an inquirer&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, saying it rightly how is the wise bhikkhu clever in the elements?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, there are eighteen elements. They are the elements of eye, forms and eye consciousness; ear, sounds, and ear consciousness; nose, scents and nose consciousness; tongue, tastes and tongue consciousness; body, touches and body consciousness; mind, ideas and mind consciousness. &acirc;nanda, these are the eighteen elements, when the bhikkhu knows and sees them, he becomes clever in the elements.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, is there another method through which the bhikkhu becomes clever in the elements?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;There is a method. The bhikkhu becomes clever in the six elements, such as the elements of earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness &acirc;nanda, these are the six elements, when the bhikkhu knows and sees them, saying it rightly he becomes clever in the elements'.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, is there another method through which the bhikkhu becomes clever in the elements?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;There is a method. These six are the elements of pleasantness, unpleasantness, pleasure, displeasure, equanimity and ignorance, when the bhikkhu knows and sees them, saying it rightly he becomes clever in the elements&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, is there another method through which the bhikkhu becomes clever in the elements?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;There is a method. These six are the elements of sensuality, non sensuality, anger, non anger, hurting and non hurting, when the bhikkhu knows and sees them, saying it rightly he becomes clever in the elements&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, is there another method through which the bhikkhu becomes clever in the elements?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;There is a method. These three are the elements, of sensuality, materiality and immateriality, when the bhikkhu knows and sees them, sayingit rightly he becomes clever in the elements.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, is there another method through which the bhikkhu becomes clever in the elements?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;There is a method. These two are the elements, such as the compounded and the uncompounded elementwhen the bhikkhu knows and sees them, saying it rightly he becomes clever in the elements.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, saying it rightly how is the bhikkhu clever in the spheres?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, these six are the internal and external spheres of the eye and forms, ear and sounds, nose and scents, tongue and tastes, body and touches and mind and ideas, when the bhikkhu knows and sees them, saying it rightly he becomes clever in the spheres.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, saying it rightly how is the bhikkhu clever in dependent arising?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, the bhikkhu knows, when this is present, this happens, when this arises, this arise. When this is not present, this does not happen, when this ceases, this cease. Such as from ignorance arise determinations, from determinations arise consciousness, from consciousness arise name and matter. From name and matter arise the six spheres, from the six spheres arise contact and from contact arise feelings. From feelings arise craving, from craving arises holding, from holding arises being and from being arises birth. From birth arises decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness displeasure and distress. Thus arises the complete mass of unpleasantness. With the cessation of ignorance, cease determinations, with the cessaton of determinations cease consciousness, with the cessation of consciousness cease name and matter. With the cessation of name and matter cease the six spheres, with the cessation of the six spheres cease contact. With the cessation of contact cease feelings, with the cessation of feelings cease craving, with the cessation of craving ceases holding. With the cessation of holding ceasesbeing, with the cessaton of being ceases birth and with the cessation of birth cease decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. Thus ceases the complete mass of unpleasantness. When the bhikkhu knows and sees this, saying it rghtly he becomes clever in dependent arising&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, saying it rightly how is the bhikkhu clever in the possible and impossible.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, the bhikkhu knows, it is impossible, that one come to right view should take any determination as permanent.
