An&agrave;thapi&iuml;&oacute;ika</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">I heard thus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">At one time the Blessed One lived
in An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery in Jeta's
grove in S&agrave;vatthi. The householder
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika was seriously ill and
suffering badly at that time. He addressed a certain man and said.
`Good man approach the Blessed One, worship the Blessed One for my sake
with your head at his feet, and tell. "Venerable sir, the householder
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika is seriously ill. Also
approach venerable S&agrave;riputta worship venerable
S&agrave;riputta for my sake with your head at his feet and tell.
Venerable sir, the householder
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika is seriously ill, it is
good if venerable S&agrave;riputta would approach the householder
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's house out of
compassion.&ucirc;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">That man agreeing, approached the
Blessed One, worshipped the Blessed One, sat on a side and said.
"Venerable sir, the householder
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika is seriously ill and he
worships the Blessed One with his head at the feet of the Blessed One.
Then he approached venerable S&agrave;riputta, worshipped him, sat
on a side and said. "Venerable sir, the householder
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika is seriously ill, he
worships venerable S&agrave;ariputta with his head at the feet of
venerable S&agrave;riputta and also says, it is good if venerable
S&agrave;riputta would approach the householder
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's house out of
compassion.&ucirc;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Venerable S&agrave;riputta
accepted the message silently, put on his robes and taking bowl and
robes, and accompanied by venerable &acirc;nanda as the second
recluse, approached the house of
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika. Sitting on the prepared
seats venerable S&agrave;riputta said. `Householder, how are you
feeling? Would you survive? Are the unpleasant feelings decreasing or
increasing? Do the feelings show the increasing end or the decreasing
end?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Good sir, S&agrave;riputta, I
do not feel well, will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe
and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing
until the end. Good sir, S&agrave;riputta, my top hurts a lot. I
feel as though a strong man was giving me a headdress with a strong
cloth. I do not feel well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings
are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are
increasing until the end. Good sir, S&agrave;riputta, my belly
hurts a lot as though a lot of air was turning about in my belly. I
feel as though a clever butcher or his apprentice was carving my belly
with a sharp butcher's knife I do not feel well and will not survive.
My unpleasant feelings are severe and increasing, not decreasing. The
unpleasant feelings are increasing until the end. Good sir,
S&agrave;riputta, there is a lot burning in my body. I feel as
though two strong men taking me by my hands and feet are pulling me to
a pit of burning embers and are scorching and burning me. I do not feel
well and will not survive. My unpleasant feelings are severe and
increasing, not decreasing. The unpleasant feelings are increasing
until the end.</font></p>

scents or pursued discursively thinking.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Hearing this the householder
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika cried loudly and tears
streamed down. Then venerable &acirc;nanda asked `Householder, do
you stick fast or sink?' <a name="BM1"></a>[</font><a href="#n1">1</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">]</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">&szlig;Good sir
&acirc;nanda, not that I stick fast or sink. Yet, I have associated
the Teacher and bhikkhus who develop the mind, but have not heard such
a discourse before this.&ucirc;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Then venerable S&agrave;riputta
said. `Householder, a discourse like this is not given to a lay person
wearing white clothes.&ucirc;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">&szlig;Good sir,
S&agrave;riputta, discourses like this should be given to lay
persons wearing white clothes. There are clansmen, with few defiling
things who deteriorate owing not hearing this sort of discourse.
Hearing these they would know the Teaching.&ucirc;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Then, venerable
S&agrave;riputta and venerable &acirc;nanda having advised the
householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika got up from
their seats and went away. Soon after they had gone the householder
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika died and was born with
the happy ones.&nbsp;<a name="BM2"></a>[</font><a href="#n2">2</a><font
 face="Times_CSX+">] Then
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika, the son of gods, when
the night was waning, illuminating Jeta's grove completely with a
resplendent light, approached the Blessed One, worshipped and stood on
a side and said to the Blessed One.</font></p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">&szlig;This pleasant Jeta's
grove the home of sages in the Community<br>
Adorned by the king of the Teaching arouses delight in me.<br>
Beings that have death are purified by actions, knowledge<br>
And a righteous, virtuous livelihood, but not by clan or wealth.<br>
Therefore a wise one, seeing his own good,<br>
Discriminating the Teaching, purifies himself<br>
Of the bhikkhus, crossed over, the ones like S&agrave;riputta,<br>
In wisdom, virtues and appeasement are the foremost.&ucirc;</font></p>
</dir>
</dir>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Saying this,
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika, the son of the gods
waited for the Blessed One's approval. Knowing the Teacher approves my
words, worshipped the Blessed One and went round him with his right
towards the Teacher and disappeared from there. Next day the Blessed
One, addressed the bhikkhus. `Bhikkhus, a certain son of the gods when
the night was waning, illuminating Jeta's grove completely with a
resplendent light, approached me worshipped and stood on a side and
said.</font></p>

waited for my approval. Knowing that I approved his words, worshipped
and went round me with his right towards me and disappeared from there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Hearing this venerable
&acirc;nanda said. `Venerable sir, is that
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika, the son of the gods?
The householder, An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika was
made happy by venerable S&agrave;riputta.&ucirc;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">&szlig;Good! &acirc;nanda,
you are right. You have attained that much, which could be attained
through reasoning.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">He is no other, but
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika the son of the gods'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">The Blessed One said thus and
venerable &acirc;nanda delighted in the words of the Blessed One.</font></p>

is to crave for this world and to sink is to give up hopes. If either
of these happened it is loss for the householder. Neither of them
happened.</font></p>
