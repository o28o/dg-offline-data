(111) Uninterrupted Concentration</P>
</B><P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&iuml;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. &szlig;Bhikkus, S&agrave;riputta is wise, has wide wisdom, bright intelligence, spontaneous and sharp wisdom and penetrating wisdom. S&agrave;riputta concentrates a fortinight uninterrupted, secluded from sensual desires and thoughts of demerit, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first jh&agrave;na. These things of the first jh&agrave;na such as thoughts, thought processes, joy, pleasantness, one pointedness of mind, contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, mindfulness, equanimity and attention, follow one after the other to him. They rise, persist and fade with his knowledge. He knows, these things come to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things follow one after the other, he abides with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is released and unyoked and is unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much practise they come to him.</P>
<P>&szlig;Again, bhikkhus, S&agrave;riputta, overcoming thoughts and thought processes, the mind internally appeased in one point, with joy and pleas&agrave;ntness born of concentration abides in the second jh&agrave;naThese things of the second jh&agrave;na such as internal appeasement, joy, pleasantness, one pointedness of mind, contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, mindfulness, equanimity and attention, follow one after the other, to him. They rise, persist and fade with his knowledge. He knows, these things come to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things follow one after the other, he abides with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is released and unyokedand is unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much practise they come to him.</P>
<P>&szlig;Again, bhikkhus, S&agrave;riputta, with equanimity to joy and detachment abides mindful and aware, and with the body experiences pleasantness too and abdes in the third jh&agrave;na. The noble ones say it's abiding in pleasantness mindfully. These things of the third jh&agrave;na such as equanimity, pleasantness, mindful awareness, one pointedness of mind, contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, equanimity and attention, follow one after the other to him. They rise, persist and fade with his knowledge. He knows, these things come to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things follow one after the other, he abides with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is released unyoked and unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much practise they come to him.</P>
<P>&szlig;Again, bhikkhus, S&agrave;riputta, dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, earlier having overcome pleasure and displeasure purifying mindfulness with equanimity abides in the fourth jh&agrave;na These things of the fourth jh&agrave;na such as equanimity, neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings, observed feelings not enjoyed, purified mindfulness, one pointedness of mind, contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, equanimity and attention, follow one after the other to him. They rise, persist and fade with his knowledge. He knows, these things come to be and cause feelings to rise. When these things follow one after the other, he abides with a mind that does not settle, is not bound, is released and unyokedand is unrestricted. knows there is an escape beyond this. With much practise they come to him.</P>
<P>&szlig;Again, bhikkhus, S&agrave;riputta, overcoming all perceptions, of matter and anger, not attending to various perceptions, with space is boundless attains to the sphere of space. Those things of the sphere of space such as the perception of space, one pointedness of mind, contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, equanimity and attention, follow one after the other to him. They rise, persist and fade with his knowledge. He knows, these things come to be and cause feelings to rise.

<P>&szlig;Again, bhikkhus, S&agrave;riputta, overcoming all perceptions of space with consciousness is boundless attains to the sphere of consciousness. Those things of the sphere of consciousness such as the perception of consciousness, one pointedness of mind, contact, feelings, perceptions, intentions, interest, resolution, effort, equanimity and attention, follow one after the other. They rise, persist and fade with his knowledge. He knows, these things come to be and cause feelings to rise.

<P>&szlig;Again, bhikkhus, S&agrave;riputta, overcoming all perceptions of nothingnessattains to the sphere of neither perception nor non perception. He mindfully rises from that attainment and reflects the things, that have passed away ceased and changed. He knows, these things come to be and cause feelings to rise.

<P>&szlig;Bhikkhus, saying it rightly, it is S&agrave;riputta that has mastered and completed the noble ones' virtues, mastered and completed the noble ones' concentration, mastered and completed the noble ones' perception, mastered and completed the noble ones' release. Sayng it rightly it is only S&agrave;riputta that has mastered and completed the noble ones' virtues, concentration, wisdom and release.</P>
<P>&szlig;Bhikkhus, saying it rightly, he is the Blessed One's own son born of the mouth, born of the Teaching, the sign of the Teaching, the heritage of the Teaching and notone born from the heritage of material.</P>
<P>&szlig;Bhikkhus, S&agrave;riputta follows rolling the noble wheel of the Teaching, rightfully rolled by the Thus Gone One.&ucirc;</P>
