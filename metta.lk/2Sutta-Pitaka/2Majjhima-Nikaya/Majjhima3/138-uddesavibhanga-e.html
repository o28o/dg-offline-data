</I>(138) Point-by-Point Classification</P>
</B><P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&iuml;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. `Bhikkhus I will give the point by point classification, listen attentively,' Those bhikkhus agreed and the Blessed One said thus. `Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines, he finds his external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding is not worried. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu's external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding is not worried, there would not be to him future arisings of birth, decay, death and unpleasantness,' The Blessed One said thus, got up from his seat and went to his dwelling.</P>
<P>Soon after the Blessed One had left, it occurred to those bhikkhus. The Blessed One has given this short exposition and without giving the detailed explanation has got up from his seat and gone to his dwelling `Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines, he finds his external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding is not worried. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu's external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding is not worried, there would not be to him future arisings of birth, decay, death and unpleasantness,' Who could give us the detailed explanation to this short exposition given by the Blessed One?</P>
<P>It occurred to those bhikkhus, venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na is praised by the Teacher as well as by the wise co-associates in the holy life. It is possible for venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na to give the detailed exposition for this short exposition given by the Blessed One. What if we approached venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na and asked this. Then those bhikkhus approached venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said. `Friend, Kacc&agrave;na, the Blessed One gave this short exposition and without giving the detailed exposition got up from the seat and went to his dwelling. -'Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines, he finds his external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding is not worried. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu's external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding is not worried, there would not be to him future arisings of birth, decay, death and unpleasantness,' Now who could give us the detailed exposition of this short exposition?&ucirc;</P>

<P>&szlig;Friends, it is like a man in need of heartwood, going in search of it, come to a standing huge tree full of heartwood, ignoring the heartwood, roots and trunk was to think that the branches and leaves was the heartwood. In the same manner, the venerable ones come face to face with the Teacher have ignored him and should ask it from me. That Blessed One knows, sees, has become wise, has become the Teaching and has become Brahm&agrave;. He preaches and practises, is the bringer of meanings, the giver of deathlessness, the lord of the Teachingand thus gone. Now is the right time to ask this from him and as he explains it, we will bear it in our minds'.</P>

<P>&szlig;Then friends, listen and attend carefully,' Those bhkkhus agreed and venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na said thus `The Blessed One has given this short exposition and without giving the detailed explanation has got up from his seat and gone to his dwelling `Bhikkhus, in whatever manner the bhikkhu examines, he finds his external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding he is not worried. Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu's external consciousness is not scattered, internally is not settled and without a holding is not worried, there would not be to him future arisings of birth, decay, death and unpleasantness' Of this short exposition, I understand the detailed explanation thus.</P>
