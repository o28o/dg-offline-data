</I>(122) The Longer Discourse on Voidness</P>
</B><P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived with the Sakyas in Nigrodha's monastery in Kapilavatthu. The Blessed One put on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes entered Kapilavatthu for alms. Gone the alms round and after the meal was over, approached the Sakya K&agrave;lakhemaka'smonastery to spend the day. At that time many beds and seats were arranged in the Sakya K&agrave;lakhemaka's monastery. It occurred to the Blessed One: Many beds and seats are arranged in the Sakya K&agrave;lakhemaka's monastery. There should be many bhikkhus abiding here.</P>
<P>At that time venerable &acirc;nanda was in the Sakya Gha&ntilde;&agrave;ya's monastery engaged in preparing robes. The Blessed One getting up from the seclusion in the evening approached the Sakya Gha&ntilde;&agrave;ya's monastery sat on the prepared seat and addressed venerable &acirc;nanda `&acirc;nanda, many beds and seats are arranged in the Sakya K&agrave;lakhemaka's monastery. Are there many bhikkhus abiding there?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, many beds and seats are arranged in the Sakya K&agrave;lakhemaka's monastery, there are many bhikkhus abiding there. Venerable sir, it is the time for preparing robes.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, the bhikkhu does not shine, attached to, fond of, yoked to and delighting in company and society. It is not possible that a bhikkhuattached to, fond of, yoked to and delighting in company and society, should be a quick and easy gainer for nothing of pleasures of non sensuality, seclusion, appeasement and enlightenment. It is possible that a bhikkhu withdrawn from the crowd should be a quick, easy gainer for nothing, of the pleasures of non sensuality, seclusion, appeasement and enlightenment. It is possible that he should attain the desired release of mind in stages or attain the unshakeable state instantly and abide.&nbsp;<A NAME="BM1"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n1">1</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] &acirc;nanda, I do not see the attachment to a single matter, the change of which, thorough attachment would not arouse grief, lament, unpleasantness displeasure and distress.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, the Thus Gone One has realized this abiding, in which not attending to any signs, to abide internally in voidness. To meet the Thus Gone One abiding thus, bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples male and female, kings, chief ministers of kings, those of other faiths and their disciples approach. To them the Thus Gone One speaks only words that slant and bend towards seclusion, withdrawl from sensuality and undoubtedly words turning away from desires. Therefore &acirc;nanda, the bhikkhu should desire to abide internally void. For that the bhikkhu should establish, settle, bring the mind to a single point and concentrate.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, how does the bhikkhu establish, settle, bring the mind to a single point and concentrate? The bhikkhu secluding the mind from sensual desires and demerit, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion attains to the first jh&agrave;na. Overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts, the mind internally appeased and brought to a single point and with joy and pleasantness born of concentration attains to the second jh&agrave;na. ... re ... &ntilde;hird jh&agrave;na ... re ... fourth jh&agrave;na. &acirc;nanda, in this manner the bhikkhu establishes, settles, brings the mind to a single point and concentrates. Then he attends to internal voidness.&nbsp;<A NAME="BM2"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n2">2</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] When internal voidness is attended to, the mind does not spring, settle and is not released.

Then he attends to internal voidness. When internal voidness is attended to, the mind springs, settles and is released. When this is so, the bhikkhu should know, attending to internal voidness, my mind springs, settles and is released. Becoming aware of this, the bhikkhu attends to external voidness and internal and external voidness.&nbsp;<A NAME="BM3"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n3">3</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] Attends to imperturbabilityWhen imperturbability is attended to, the mind springs, settles and is released. When this is so, the bhikkhu should know, attending to imperturbability, my mind springs, settles and is released. The bhikkhu becmes aware of this.</P>
<P>The mind of the bhikkhu abiding thus, bends to walking. He walks and becomes aware, when walking, coveting, displeased thoughts of demerit do not seep. He becomes aware of this.

<P>&acirc;nanda, these five are the strands of sensual pleasures. What are the five? Agreeable pleasant forms cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sensusal desires agreeable pleasant sounds cognizable by ear consciousness arousing fondness and sensusal desires Agree&agrave;ble pleasant smells cognizable by nose consciousness arousing fondness and sensusal desires Agreeable pleasant tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness arousing fondness and sensusal desires Agreeable pleasant touches cognizable by body consciousness arousing fondness and sensusal desires. &acirc;nanda, these are the five strands of sensual pleasures, for which the bhikkhu should constantly search his mind.

<P>&acirc;nanda, these five are the holding masses, of which the bhikkhu should abide reflecting arising and fading. This is matter, this the arising of matter and this the fading of matter. These are feelings, this the arising of feelings and this the fading of feelings. These are perceptions, this the arising of perceptions and this the fading of perceptions. These are determinations, this is the arising of determinations and this is the fading of determinations. This is consciousness, this is the arising of consciousness and this the fading of consciousness. When abiding reflecting the arising and fading of the five holding masses, the conceit `I am' gets dispelled.

<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, it is not suitable that the disciple should follow the Teacher for explanatons of discourses and verses. What is the reason? You have heard this Teaching since long, borne it, recited it verbally, experienced it in the mind and penetratingly seen it. As for these talks of austerities, talk suitable to analyse the mind, talk conductive to giving up, to detachment, to cessation, to appeasement, to knowledge, to enlightenment and extinction.

For such talk, it is suitable that the dicciple should follow the Teacher even when chased.</P>
<P>Even when this is so, there comes misfortune to the Teacher, misfortune to the disciple and misfortune to the holy life. &acirc;nanda, how comes, misfortune to the Teacher? A certain Teacher abounds a secluded dwelling, a remote place, the root of a tree, a mountain grotto, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a jungle forest, an open space a heap of straw.
