</I>(134) A Single Auspicious Attachment To Venerable Lomasangiya</P>
</B><P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&iuml;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. At that time venerable Lomasangiya was dwelling in Nigrodha's monasteryin Kapilavatthu in the Sakya country. Then the deity Chandana when the night was waning illuminated the whole Nigrodha monastery with a resplendent light, approached venerable Lomasangiya, stood on a side and said'Bhikkhu, do you remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment?</P>
<P>&szlig;Friend, I do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Do you remember it?</P>
<P>&szlig;Bhikkhu, I too do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Bhikkhu, do you remember the verses of the single auspicious attachment.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Friend, I do not remember the verses of the single auspicious attachment. Do you remember them?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Bhikkhu, I remember the verses of the single auspicious attachment.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Friend, how is it that you remember the verses of the ssingle auspicious attachment?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Bhikkhu, once the Blessed One abode under the Paricchattaka shade with the gods of the thirty and there the short and detailed explanation ofthe single auspicious attachment was preached to the gods of the thirty-three.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Do not recollect the past, nor desire the future,<BR>
The past is over, the future has not come.<BR>
These things of the present, see them with insight as they arise<BR>
Not faltering and not moved, think about them.<BR>
Today itself the dispelling should be done<BR>
Tomorrow death might come<BR>
We will not have any associations with Death and his great army<BR>
You should abide dispelling thus, day and night zealously,<BR>
This is the single auspicious attachment, the appeased sage tells.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&szlig;Bhikkhu, in this manner I remember the verses of the single auspicious attachment. Bhikkhu, learn, practise and remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment, it tells the fundamentalsof the holy life. saying this, the deity vanished from there.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable Lomasangiya at the end of that night, arranged his dwelling and taking bowl and robes, left on a tour to reach S&agrave;vatthi. Coming in stages he reached the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&iuml;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi, approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side. Venerable Lomasangiya said. `Venerable sir, once I was dwelling in Nigrodha's monasteryin Kapilavatthu in the Sakya country. Then a certain deity, when the night was waning illuminated the whole Nigrodha monastery with a resplendent light, approached me, stood on a side and said'Bhikkhu, do you remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment? I said friend, I do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Do you remember it? Then that deity said, bhikkhu, I too do not remember the short and detailed exposition of the single auspicious attachment. Bhikkhu, do you remember the verses of the single auspicious attachment?

Venerablesir he said, bhikkhu, once the Blessed One abode under the Paricchattaka shade with the gods of the thirty and there the short and detailed explanation ofthe single auspicious attachment was preached to the gods of the thirty-three.</P><DIR>
