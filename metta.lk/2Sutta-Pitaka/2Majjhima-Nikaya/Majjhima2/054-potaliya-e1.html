</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">(54) To The Householder Potaliya</P>
</B><P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in Anguttar&agrave;pa in a hamlet named &acirc;pana in the baz&agrave;r. Then the Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered &acirc;pana for alms. After returning from the alms round and after the meal was over, the Blessed One entered a forest stretch and sat at the root of a tree to spend the day. The householder Potaliya too completely dressed and with a tent, walking and wandering for exercise, entered the forest stretch and approached the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings and stood on a side. Then the Blessed One addressed the householder. :'Householder, there are seats, if you wish sit. ' When this was said, the householder Potaliya, thought the recluse Gotama, addresses me as a householder, was angry and averse and would not talk. For the second time the Blessed One said 'Householder, there are seats if you wish sit. ' When this was said, the householder Potaliya, thought the recluse Gotama, addresses me as a householder, was angry and averse and would not talk For the third time the Blessed One said. 'Householder, there are seats, if you wish sit. ' When this was said, the householder Potaliya, thought the recluse Gotama, addresses me as a householder, was angry and averse and said. 'It is not suitable that the recluse Gotama should address me as a householder. ' 'By your signs and attributes, you are a householder. ' 'Good Gotama, I have come to the end of all my actions and business. Whatever I had as wealth, grains, gold and silver is given to my sons and I do not advise or blame them. I care only for my food and clothing. Thus I have come to the end of all my actions and business. ' 'Householder, your ending of all actions and business is different from the ending of all actions and business in the noble ones Dispensation. ' 'Venerable sir, it is good if the Blessed One teaches me the ending of all actions and business in the noble ones Dispensation. ' 'Then householder, listen carefully, I will preach.</P>
<P>Householder, there are eight ways to end all actions and business in the noble ones dispensation. What are the eight?.

For the purpose of maintaining non-anger and non-malice, anger and malice should be given up. For the sake of non-conceit, conceit should be given up. These stated in short conduce to the ending of all actions and business in the dispensation of the noble ones.

<P>. Householder, these are the eight things stated in short and explained, for the ending of business and actions in the dispensation of the noble ones. Yet with this much only, actions and business will not come to the end in the noble ones' Dispensation. ' 'Venerable sir, how does the complete ending of actions and business come about in the dispensation of the noble ones.

<P>Householder, this is the ending of all actions and business in the dispensation of the nobe ones. Householder, do you see this ending of all actions and business in the Dispensation of the noble ones, evident in you?' 'What am I, venerable sir, I am far away from ending of all actions and business of the dispensation of the noble ones. Venerable sir, earlier, we thought, the ascetics of other sects were thoroughbreds and fed them thinking they were thoroughbreds, and placed faith in them. The bhikkhus, we thought were not thoroughbreds, fed them thinking they were not thoroughbreds and did not place faith in them, thinking they were not thoroughbreds. Now we know the ascetics of other sects are not the thoroughbreds, and feed them knowing they are not the thoroughbreds and do not place faith in them. Now we know that the bhikkhus are the thoroughbreds, feed them knowing that they are the thoroughbreds and place faith in them, knowing they are thoroughbreds. Venerable sir, you have produced in me love and reverence for the recluses. Now I understand venerable sir. It is as though something overturned is reinstalled. Something covered is made manifest. As though the path was shown to someone who had lost his way. It is like an oil lamp was lighted for the darkness, so that, those who have sight could see forms. In various ways the Blessed One has explained the Teaching. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today till life lasts. '</P>
