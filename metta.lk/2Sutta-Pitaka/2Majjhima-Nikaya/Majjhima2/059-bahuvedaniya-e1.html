</I>(59) The Discourse On Many Feelings</P>
</B><P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. The carpenter Pancakanga approached venerable Ud&agrave;yi worshipped and sat on a side and asked `Venerable sir, how many feelings are made known by the Blessed One?' `Householder, three feelings, are made known by the Blessed One. They are pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings'. `Venerable Ud&agrave;yi, there are only two feelings pointed out by the Blessed One. They are pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings, neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings are an exalted state declared by the Blessed One'. For the second time venerable Ud&agrave;yi said to the carpenter Pancakanga. `Householder, not two feelings, the Blessed One has said of three feelings, pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings'. For the second time, the carpenter Pancakanga said, `Venerable Ud&agrave;yi, two feelings are made known by the Blessed One and they are pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings. This neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings, is an exalted state is said, by the Blessed One'. For the third time venerable Ud&agrave;yi said to the carpenter Pancakanga. `Householder, the Blessed One has said of three feelings, pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings and neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings'. For the third time, the carpenter Pancakanga said. `Venerable Ud&agrave;yi, only two feelings are pointed out by the Blessed One and they are pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings. The neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings, is an exalted state is said, by the Blessed One'. Venerable Ud&agrave;yi could not convince the carpenter Pancakanga and the carpenter Pancakanga could not convince venerable Ud&agrave;yi.</P>
<P>Venerable &acirc;nanda heard this conversation between venerable Ud&agrave;yi and the carpenter Pancakanga and approached the Blessed One worshipped the Blessed One and sat on a side and related the complete conversation to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One addressed venerable &acirc;nanda. `Two feelings are also declared by me, three in another, five in another, six in another, eighteen in another, thirty-six in another and also in another one hundred and eight feelings. Thus &acirc;nanda, this Teaching is analytically preached. &acirc;nanda, in this analytical Teaching, if one does not approve another's view appreciating and accepting it, this kind of thing could happen and quarrels, fights, disputes and verbal fights would ensue. Therefore you should be united, open hearted, should co-operate like milk and water, and should look at each other with understanding and abide'.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, there are five strands of sense desires. What five: Pleasant agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires. Pleasant agreeable sounds-Pleasant agreeable smells-- Pleasant agreeable tastes -- Pleasant agreeable touches cognizable by body consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires. &acirc;nanda, these are the five strands of sensual desires.

<P>&acirc;nanda, there is a possibility, for ascetics of other sects to question, does the recluse Gotama declare the cessation of perceptions and feelings also as a feeling? How could that happen? How could that be? This is our reply to those ascetics of other sects. Friends, for the matter of only feeling pleasant, the Blessed One does not declare it as pleasant. Whenever pleasantness is gained to that the Blessed One declares pleasant. <A NAME="BM1"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n1">1</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">]</P>
<P>The Blessed One said thus and venerable &acirc;nanda, delighted in the words of the Blessed One.</P>
<P><A NAME="n1"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#BM1">1</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] Friends for the matter of only feeling pleasant, the Blessed One does not declare it as pleasant. Whenever pleasantness is gained, to that the Blessed One declares pleasant (<I>na kho &agrave;vuso bhagav&agrave; sukha&uuml;yeva vedana&uuml; sandh&agrave;ya sukhasmi&uuml; pa¤¤&agrave;peti. apica &agrave;vuso yattha yattha sukha&uuml; upalabhati yahi&uuml; yahi&uuml; ta&uuml; ta&uuml; tath&agrave;gato sukhasmi&uuml; pa¤¤&agrave;peti</I>). Yet when pleasantness is gained, to that the Blessed One declares pleasant. Thediscourse shows how the least pleasantness in the sensual sphere and the most exalted pleasantness in the immaterial sphere is gained, yet the Blessed One is not pleased clinging to even that highest pleasantness. Extinction and enlightenment means giving up that too.</P>
