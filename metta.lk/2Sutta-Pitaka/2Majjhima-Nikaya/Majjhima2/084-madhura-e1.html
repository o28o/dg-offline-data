</I>(84) The Discourse Given at Madhura</P>
</B><P>I heard thus. At one time venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana was living in Madhura in the Gunda forest. King Avantiputta of Madhura heard that venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana was living in Madhura in the Gunda forest, and fame of venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana had spread, he is wise, learned, a clever preacher, a perfected one since long, and it is good to see such perfect ones. Then king Avantiputta of Madhura getting ready good conveyances went to see venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana in all royal splendour. Going as far as the conveyances could carry them went on foot and approached venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;yana. Approaching and exchanging friendly greetings with venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;ya, sat on a side and said thus: &szlig;Venerable sir, brahmins say, brahmins are from the chief clan, the most superior in appearance, all other clans are inferior, its the brahmins born from the mouth of Brahma, his hereditary sons, that purify, non-brahmins do not purify. What has good Kacc&agrave;yana to say about this?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Great king it's only an utterance in the world: Brahmins are from the chief clan, the most superior in appearance, all other clans are inferior, its only the brahmins born from the mouth of Brahma, his hereditary sons, that purify, non-brahmins do not purify. Great king, this, `Brahmins are from the chief clan, the most superior in appearance, all other clans are inferior, its the brahmins born from the mouth of Brahma, his hereditary sons, that purify, non-brahmins do not purify' you should know that it is only an utterance in this manner. Great king, to a warrior, there is prosperity, wealth, grains, silver, or soverign gold, then would a warrior, stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to him pleasantly, or would a brahmin, or would one of householder clan, or would, one of out caste clan, stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to him pleasantly?</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Kaccayana, if there is prosperity, wealth, grains, silver, or soverign gold to a warrior, then a warrior would stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to him pleasantly, or even a brahmin, or even one of householder clan, or evenone of out caste clan, would stand up, retire last, do his biddings and talk to him pleasantly.&ucirc;</P>

Here, great king a certain warrior breaks into a house, carries away loot, robs, waits in ambush, or goes to others' wives, then people get hold of him and show him to the king.

<P>When this was said, king Avantiputta of Madhura said thus to venerable Mah&agrave;kaccayana. &szlig;Now I understand good Kacc&agrave;yana, it's like something over turned, is reinstalled, as something covered is made manifest, as the path was shown to someone who had lost his way. It's as though an oil lamp was lighted for those who have sight to see forms in the dark. In various ways the Teaching, is explained by good Kaccayana. Now I take refuge in good Kaccayana, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I be remembered as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until the end of life.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Great king do not take my refuge, take refuge in that Blessed One as I have done.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Kaccayana, where does the Blessed One, perfect rightfully enlightened live now?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Great king, the Blessed One, perfect rightfully enlightened has passed away.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Kaccayana, if I hear, that the Blessed One perfcct rightfully enlightened is seventy miles from here, I would go there, to see the Blessed One. If I hear that the Blessed One perfcct rightfully enlightened is one hundred and forty miles away from here two hundred and ten miles from here, three hundred and fifty miles from here, seven hundred miles from here, I would go there, to see the Blessed One. Good Kaccayana, since the Blessed One, perfect rightfully enlightened has passed away. I take refuge in that Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May good Kaccayana bear me as a lay disciple from today until I die.&ucirc;</P>
