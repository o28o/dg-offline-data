</font><font face="Times_CSX+">(62) Advice to Venerable
R&agrave;hula &THORN;The Longer Discourse</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">I heard thus. At one time the
Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in
S&agrave;vatthi. Then the Blessed One put on robes in the morning
and taking bowl and robes entered S&agrave;vatthi for alms.
Venerable R&agrave;hula too putting on robes, taking bowl and robes
followed the Blessed One close behind. Then the Blessed One looked back
and addressed venerable R&agrave;hula: </font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">&szlig;R&agrave;hula,
whatever matter, in the past, in the future, or at present, internal or
external, coarse or fine, unexalted or exalted, far or near, all matter
is not mine, that is not me, that is not my self. This has to be seen
as it really is with right wisdom.&ucirc;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">&szlig;Blessed One, is it only
matter?&ucirc;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">&szlig;R&agrave;hula,
feelings also, perceptions also, determinations and consciousness too.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Then it occurred to venerable
R&agrave;hula, advised by the Blessed One, &szlig;What is the
use of going for alms today?&ucirc; Venerable R&agrave;hula,
stopped short, and sat with legs crossed at the root of a certain tree,
the body straight and mindfulness established in front. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Venerable S&agrave;riputta saw
venerable R&agrave;hula seated cross-legged at the root of a
certain tree, the body straight and mindfulness established in front of
him. He said, &szlig;R&agrave;hula, develop in-breathing and
out-breathing. When, in- and out-breathing is developed and made much,
it brings good results and benefits.&ucirc; </font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">In the evening, venerable
R&agrave;hula got up from his seclusion, approached the Blessed
One, worshipped, sat on a side and said, &szlig;Venerable sir,
developed and made much, in which ways do in-breaths and out-breaths
bring good results and benefits?&ucirc;<a name="BM1"></a>&nbsp;[</font><a
