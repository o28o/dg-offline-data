</I><B>(32) The longer Discourse in the Gosinga Forest</P>
</B><P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Gosinga S&agrave;la forest, with many well versed elder disciples such as venerables S&agrave;riputta, Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na, Mah&agrave;kassapa, Anuruddha, Revata, &acirc;nanda and many other well versed elder disciples. Venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na getting up from his seclusion in the evening approached venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa and said; Kassapa, let us go to venerable S&agrave;riputta, to hear the Teaching. Venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa agreed and venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na, venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa and venerable Anuruddha approached venerable S&agrave;riputta. Venerable &acirc;nanda saw venerables, Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na, Mah&agrave;kassapa and Anuruddha approaching venerable S&agrave;riputta to hear the Teaching and venerable &acirc;nanda approached venerable Revata and said, friend, Revata, the Great Men are approaching venerable S&agrave;riputta to hear the Teaching, shall we too go to hear the Teaching. Venerable Revata agreed and venerable Revata and venerable</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda approached venerable S&agrave;riputta.</P>
<P>Venerable S&agrave;riputta saw venerables Revata and &acirc;nanda coming in the distance and said, welcome friend, &acirc;nanda, the close and near attendant of the Blessed One. Friend, &acirc;nanda, in the moon light, the S&agrave;la forest is very pleasing the flowers in full bloom, give a heavenly scent. What kind of bhikkhu would adorn this S&agrave;la forest? Friend, S&agrave;riputta, a learned bhikkhu, who bears all the Teaching, treasures that, which is good at the beginning,in the middle and at the end, and declares the completely pure holy life. Of that Teaching he should become a bearer by words and practise and an experiencer of it through penetration. He would teach it to the fourfold gatherings, with the words coming to him without difficulty, for the destruction of the latent tendencies of those with sharp mental faculties. Friend, S&agrave;riputta, such a bhikkhu would adorn the Gosinga. S&agrave;la forest.</P>
<P>When this was said, venerable S&agrave;riputta addressed venerable Revata, Friend, Revata, venerable &acirc;nanda has declared this according to his understanding, now we ask you: Friend Revata, in the moon light, the S&agrave;la forest is very pleasing, the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent. What kind of bhikkhu would adorn this S&agrave;la forest? Friend, S&agrave;riputta, a bhikkhu who is fond of seclusion, yoked to internal appeasement of the mind. He would not neglect jh&agrave;na, endowed with wise reflection, and would develop the abidings without thoughts and discursive thoughts. Such a bhikkhu would adorn the Gosinga S&agrave;la forest.</P>
<P>When this was said, venerable S&agrave;riputta addressed venerable Anuruddha: Friend, Anuruddha, venerable Revata has declared this according to his understanding, now we ask you. Anuruddha, in the moon light, the S&agrave;la forest is very pleasing, the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent. What kind of bhikkhu would adorn this S&agrave;la forest? Friend, S&agrave;riputta, the bhikkhu with the heavenly eye purified beyond human would look at the thousandfold world systems. Like a man who has climbed to the top most storey of his mansion would be looking at a disc with thousandfold circumferences. In the same manner the bhikkhu with the heavenly eye purified beyond human would look at the thousandfold world systems. Such a bhikkhu would adorn the Gosinga S&agrave;la forest.</P>
<P>When this was said, venerable S&agrave;riputta addressed venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa, Friend, Kassapa, venerable Anuruddha has declared this according to his understanding, now we ask you. Kassapa. in the moon light, the S&agrave;la forest is very pleasing, the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent. What kind of bhikkhu would adorn this S&agrave;la forest? Friend, S&agrave;riputta, the bhikkhu, a forest dweller praises forest dwelling. A partaker of morsel food praises the partaking of morsel food. A rag robe wearer, praises wearing rag-robes. Confined to three robes, praises that. With few desires praises few desires, and satisfied praises satisfaction Secluded praises seclusion, withdrawn, praises withdrawal from the crowd. With aroused effort, praises arousal of effort and virtuous, praises endowment of virtues. Concentrated praises endowment of concentration and wise praises endowment of wisdom. Released praises endowment of release and endowed with the knowledge and vision of release, praises the knowledge and vision of release. Such a bhikkhu would adorn the Gosinga S&agrave;la forest.</P>
<P>When this was said, venerable S&agrave;riputta addressed venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;ana</P>
<P>Friend, Moggall&agrave;na, venerable Mah&agrave;kassapa has declared this according to his understanding, now we ask you. Friend, Moggall&agrave;na, in the moon light, the S&agrave;la forest is very pleasing, the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent. What kind of bhikkhu would adorn this S&agrave;la forest? Friend, S&agrave;riputta, two bhikkhus discussing a deep point in the Teaching would ask questions from each other. Would find replies for each others questions. They would not fall out with each other, their talk would be timely and beneficial. Such a bhikkhu would adorn the Gosinga S&agrave;la forest.</P>
<P>Then venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na addressed venerable S&agrave;riputta. Friend, S&agrave;riputta we all have declared this according to our understanding. Now we ask you. Friend, S&agrave;riputta, in the moon light, the S&agrave;la forest is very pleasing, the flowers in full bloom give a heavenly scent, what kind of bhikkhu would adorn this S&agrave;la forest. Here, friend, Moggall&agrave;na, the bhikkhu wields power over the mind, and does not abide in the power of the mind. Whatever abiding he desires to abide in the morning, in that, he abides in the morning. Whatever abiding he desires to abide in the mid day, in that he abides in the mid day. Whatever abiding he desires to abide in the evening, in that he abides in the evening. Like a head anointed king, or his chief minister who had a casket full of clothes of various colours, would choose the set of clothes he wanted to wear in the morning, in the mid day, and in the evening. In the same manner the bhikkhu wields power over the mind and does not abide in the power of the mind. In whatever abidings he desires to abide, in the morning, at mid day, and in the evening, in that respective abiding he abides in the morning, at mid day, and in the evening. Such a bhikkhu adorns the Gosinga S&agrave;la forest.</P>
<P>Then venerable S&agrave;riputta said thus to those venerable ones-Let us approach the Blessed One, and inform all this and as he explains it let us bear it in mind. Those venerable ones agreed and they approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. Then venerable S&agrave;riputta said thus to the Blessed One: Venerable sir, venerable Revata and venerable &acirc;nanda approached me to hear the Teaching, I seeing venerables Revata and &acirc;nanda coming in the distance, said welcome friend, &acirc;nanda, the close and near attendant of the Blessed One.

<P>When this was said venerable S&agrave;riputta said thus to the Blessed One -Venerable sir, Whose words are the best?. S&agrave;riputta, all these are good words, in a certain order, yet listen to what I have to say: Here, S&agrave;riputta, the bhikkhu, when the meal is over and returning from the alms round sits in a cross-legged posture, keeping his body straight and mindfulness established in front. The he determines, until my mind is released without desires, I would not change this posture. S&agrave;riputta, such a bhikkhu, adorns the Gosinga S&agrave;la forest.</P>
<P>The Blessed One said thus and the venerable ones delighted in the words of the Blessed One.</P>
<P><A NAME="n1"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#BM1">1</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] Would not neglect jh&agrave;na endowed with wise reflection (<I>an&atilde;r&agrave;kata jh&agrave;no vipassan&agrave;ya samann&agrave;gato</I>). When jh&agrave;nas are practised, they should be accompanied with wise reflection. '<I>vipassan&agrave; bh&agrave;van&agrave;</I>' is this wise reflection and it is none other than reflecting that those pure thought moments are impermanent, changing, so they are unpleasant, and so it is foolish to appropriate them as me or mine. This helps the yogi to drop the self view little by little.</P>
