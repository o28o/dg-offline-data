<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a
 name="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels'
Sanctuary. Then a number of monks from the [Blessed One's] native land,
having completed the Rains Retreat in the native land, went to the
Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.
</p>
<p>As they were sitting there, the Blessed One said to them, "Monks,
whom in our native land do the native-land monks -- his companions in
the holy life -- esteem in this way: 'Having few wants himself, he
gives talks to the monks on fewness of wants. Contented himself, he
gives talks to the monks on contentment. Secluded himself, he gives
talks to the monks on seclusion. Unentangled himself, he gives talks to
the monks on non-entanglement. Having aroused persistence in himself,
he gives talks to the monks on arousing persistence. Consummate in his
own virtue, he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in
virtue. Consummate in his own concentration, he gives talks to the
monks on becoming consummate in concentration. Consummate in his own
discernment, he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in
discernment. Consummate in his own release, he gives talks to the monks
on becoming consummate in release. Consummate in his own knowledge
&amp; vision of release, he gives talks to the monks on becoming
consummate in the knowledge &amp; vision of release. <a name="BM1">[</a><a
 href="#n1">1</a>] He is one who exhorts, informs, instructs, urges,
rouses, &amp; encourages his companions in the holy life.'" </p>
<p>"Lord, the monk named <a name="punna">Punna Mantaniputta</a>
(Mantani's son) is esteemed by the native-land monks -- his companions
in the holy life -- in this way: 'Having few wants himself, he gives
talks to the monks on fewness of wants. Contented himself, he gives
talks to the monks on contentment. Secluded himself, he gives talks to
the monks on seclusion. Unentangled himself, he gives talks to the
monks on non-entanglement. Having aroused persistence in himself, he
gives talks to the monks on arousing persistence. Consummate in his own
virtue, he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in virtue.
Consummate in his own concentration, he gives talks to the monks on
becoming consummate in concentration. Consummate in his own
discernment, he gives talks to the monks on becoming consummate in
discernment. Consummate in his own release, he gives talks to the monks
on becoming consummate in release. Consummate in his own knowledge
&amp; vision of release, he gives talks to the monks on becoming
consummate in the knowledge &amp; vision of release. He is one who
exhorts, informs, instructs, urges, rouses, &amp; encourages his
companions in the holy life.'" </p>
<p>Now at that time <a name="sariputta">Ven. S&agrave;riputta</a> was
sitting not far from the Blessed One. The thought occurred to him:
"It's a gain, a great gain for Ven. Punna Mantaniputta that his
knowledgeable companions in the holy life speak his praise point by
point in the presence of the Teacher, and that the Teacher seconds that
praise. Maybe sometime or other I, too, will go to meet with Ven. Punna
Mantaniputta; maybe I'll have some conversation with him." </p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, having stayed at Rajagaha as long as he liked,
set out wandering to <a name="S">S&agrave;vatthi</a>. Wandering by
stages, he arrived there and stayed in <a name="anatha">Jeta's Grove,
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery</a>. Ven. Punna
Mantaniputta heard, "The Blessed One has arrived at S&agrave;vatthi and
is staying near S&agrave;vatthi in Jeta's Grove,
An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's monastery." Setting his lodgings
in order and taking his robes &amp; bowl, he set out wandering to
S&agrave;vatthi. Wandering by stages, he went to where the Blessed One
was staying in Jeta's Grove, An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's
monastery. On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to
one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One instructed, urged,
roused, &amp; encouraged him with a Dhamma talk. Then Ven. Punna --
instructed, urged, roused, &amp; encouraged with the Blessed One's
Dhamma talk; delighting &amp; approving of the Blessed One's words --
got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated
him, and went to the Grove of the Blind for the day's abiding. </p>
<p>Then a certain monk went to Ven. S&agrave;riputta and, on arrival,
said to him: "Friend S&agrave;riputta, the monk named Punna
Mantaniputta whom you have so often praised -- instructed, urged,
roused, &amp; encouraged with the Blessed One's Dhamma talk; delighting
&amp; approving of the Blessed One's words -- has gotten up from his
seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him, and has gone
to the Grove of the Blind for the day's abiding." So Ven.
S&agrave;riputta quickly picked up a sitting cloth and followed right
behind Ven. Punna, keeping his head in sight. Ven. Punna plunged into
the Grove of the Blind and sat down in the shade of a tree for the
day's abiding. Ven. S&agrave;riputta also plunged into the Grove of the
Blind and sat down in the shade of a tree for the day's abiding. </p>
<p>Then in the evening, Ven. S&agrave;riputta arose from his seclusion
and went to Ven. Punna. On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings
with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he
sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Punna, "My
friend, is the holy life lived under the Blessed One?" </p>
<p>"Yes, my friend." </p>
<p>"And is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of
purity in terms of virtue?" <a name="BM2">[</a><a href="#n2">2</a>] </p>
<p>"No, my friend." </p>
<p>"Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of
purity in terms of mind [concentration]?" </p>
<p>"No, my friend." </p>
<p>"Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of
purity in terms of view?" </p>
<p>"No, my friend." </p>
<p>"Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of
purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexity?" </p>
<p>"No, my friend." </p>
<p>"Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of
purity in terms of knowledge &amp; vision of what is &amp; is not the
path?" </p>
<p>"No, my friend." </p>
<p>"Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of
purity in terms of knowledge &amp; vision of the way?" </p>
<p>"No, my friend." </p>
<p>"Then is the holy life lived under the Blessed One for the sake of
purity in terms of knowledge &amp; vision?" </p>
<p>"No, my friend." </p>
<p>"When asked if the holy life is lived under the Blessed One for the
sake of purity in terms of virtue, you say, 'No, my friend.' When asked
if the holy life is lived under the Blessed One for the sake of purity
in terms of mind ... view ... the overcoming of perplexity ...
knowledge &amp; vision of what is &amp; is not the path ... knowledge
&amp; vision of the way ... knowledge &amp; vision, you say, 'No, my
friend.' For the sake of what, then, my friend, is the holy life lived
under the Blessed One?" </p>
<p>"The holy life is lived under the Blessed One, my friend, for the
sake of total Unbinding through lack of clinging." <a name="BM3">[</a><a
 href="#n3">3</a>] </p>
<p>"But is purity in terms of virtue total Unbinding through lack of
clinging?" </p>
<p>"No, my friend." </p>
<p>"Then is purity in terms of mind ... view ... the overcoming of
perplexity ... knowledge &amp; vision of what is &amp; is not the path
... knowledge &amp; vision of the way ... knowledge &amp; vision total
Unbinding through lack of clinging?" </p>
<p>"No, my friend." </p>
<p>"Then is total Unbinding through lack of clinging something apart
from these qualities?" </p>
<p>"No, my friend." </p>
<p>"When asked if purity in terms of virtue ... mind ... view ... the
overcoming of perplexity ... knowledge &amp; vision of what is &amp; is
not the path ... knowledge &amp; vision of the way ... knowledge &amp;
vision is total Unbinding through lack of clinging, you say, 'No, my
friend.' But when asked if total Unbinding through lack of clinging is
something apart from these qualities, you say, 'No, my friend.' Now
how, my friend, is the meaning of these statements to be understood?" </p>
<p>"If the Blessed One had described purity in terms of virtue as total
Unbinding through lack of clinging, my friend, then he would have
defined something still accompanied by clinging as total Unbinding
through lack of clinging. If he had described purity in terms of mind
... view ... the overcoming of perplexity ... knowledge &amp; vision of
what is &amp; is not the path ... knowledge &amp; vision of the way ...
knowledge &amp; vision as total Unbinding through lack of clinging,
then he would have defined something still accompanied by clinging as
total Unbinding through lack of clinging. But if total Unbinding
through lack of clinging were apart from these qualities, then a
run-of-the-mill person would be totally unbound, inasmuch as a
run-of-the-mill person is apart from these qualities. </p>
<p>"So, my friend, I will give you an analogy, for there are cases
where it's through analogies that knowledgeable people can understand
the meaning of what is being said. <a name="chariots">Suppose that</a>
while <a name="pasenadi">King Pasenadi Kosala</a> was staying at
S&agrave;vatthi, some urgent business were to arise at <a name="saketa">Saketa</a>;
and that between S&agrave;vatthi and Saketa seven relay chariots were
made ready for him. Coming out the door of the inner palace in
S&agrave;vatthi, he would get in the first relay chariot. By means of
the first relay chariot he would reach the second relay chariot.
Getting out of the first relay chariot he would get in the second relay
chariot. By means of the second relay chariot he would reach the third
... by means of the third he would reach the fourth ... by means of the
fourth, the fifth ... by means of the fifth, the sixth ... by means of
the sixth he would reach the seventh relay chariot. Getting out of the
sixth relay chariot he would get in the seventh relay chariot. By means
of the seventh relay chariot he would finally arrive at the door of the
inner palace at Saketa. As he arrived there, his friends &amp;
companions, relatives &amp; kin would ask him, 'Great king, did you
come from S&agrave;vatthi to the door of the inner palace in Saketa by
means of this chariot?' Answering in what way, my friend, would King
Pasenadi Kosala answer them correctly?" </p>
<p>"Answering in this way, my friend, he would answer them correctly:
'Just now, as I was staying at S&agrave;vatthi, some urgent business
arose at Saketa; and between S&agrave;vatthi and Saketa seven relay
chariots were made ready for me. Coming out the door of the inner
palace in S&agrave;vatthi, I got in the first relay chariot. By means
of the first relay chariot I reached the second relay chariot. Getting
out of the first relay chariot I got in the second relay chariot. By
means of the second relay chariot I reached the third ... by means of
the third I reached the fourth ... by means of the fourth, the fifth
... by means of the fifth, the sixth ... by means of the sixth I
reached the seventh relay chariot. Getting out of the sixth relay
chariot I got in the seventh relay chariot. By means of the seventh
relay chariot I finally arrived at the door of the inner palace at
Saketa.' Answering in this way, he would answer them correctly." </p>
<p>"In the same way, my friend, purity in terms of virtue is simply for
the sake of purity in terms of mind. Purity in terms of mind is simply
for the sake of purity in terms of view. Purity in terms of view is
simply for the sake of purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexity.
Purity in terms of the overcoming of perplexity is simply for the sake
of purity in terms of knowledge &amp; vision of what is &amp; is not
the path. Purity in terms of knowledge &amp; vision of what is &amp; is
not the path is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge
&amp; vision of the way. Purity in terms of knowledge &amp; vision of
the way is simply for the sake of purity in terms of knowledge &amp;
vision. Purity in terms of knowledge &amp; vision is simply for the
sake of total Unbinding through lack of clinging. And it's for the sake
of total Unbinding through lack of clinging that the holy life is lived
under the Blessed One." </p>
<p>When this was said, Ven. S&agrave;riputta said to Ven. Punna
Mantaniputta: "What is your name, friend, and how do your companions in
the holy life know you?" </p>
<p>"My name is Punna, friend, and my companions in the holy life know
me as Mantaniputta." </p>
<p>"How amazing, my friend, how astounding, that Ven. Punna
Mantaniputta has answered point by point with profound, profound
discernment in the manner of a learned disciple who has rightly
understood the Teacher's message! It's a gain, a great gain, for any of
his companions in the holy life who get to see him and visit with him.
Even if they had to carry him around on a cushion placed on top of
their heads in order to see him and visit with him, it would be a gain
for them, a great gain. And the fact that I have gotten to see him and
visit with him has been a gain, a great gain for me." </p>
<p>When this was said, Ven. Punna said to Ven. S&agrave;riputta: "And
what is your name, friend, and how do your companions in the holy life
know you?" </p>
<p>"My name is <a name="upatissa">Upatissa</a>, friend, and my
companions in the holy life know me as S&agrave;riputta." </p>
<p>"What? I've been talking with the disciple who is like the Teacher
himself without knowing that it is Ven. S&agrave;riputta? Had I known
it was Ven. S&agrave;riputta, I wouldn't have answered at such length.
How amazing, my friend, how astounding, that Ven. S&agrave;riputta has
questioned point by point with profound, profound discernment in the
manner of a learned disciple who has rightly understood the Teacher's
message! It's a gain, a great gain, for any of his companions in the
holy life who get to see him and visit with him. Even if they had to
carry him around on a cushion placed on top of their heads in order to
see him and visit with him, it would be a gain for them, a great gain.
And the fact that I have gotten to see him and visit with him has been
a gain, a great gain for me." </p>
<p>In this way did both great beings rejoice in each other's good
words. </p>

<p><b><a name="n2">2</a>.</b> Ven. S&agrave;riputta and Ven. Punna
speak of this list of seven purities -- purity in terms of virtue,
mind, view, the overcoming of perplexity, knowledge &amp; vision of
what is &amp; is not the path, knowledge &amp; vision of the way, and
knowledge &amp; vision -- as if it were a teaching familiar to both of
them, and yet nowhere else is it mentioned as a Buddhist teaching in
the discourses. The Atthaka Vagga (Sn IV), however, mentions various
non-Buddhist sectarians who spoke of purity as the goal of their
teaching and who variously defined that purity in terms of virtue,
view, knowledge, &amp; practice. Perhaps the seven types of purity
listed in this discourse were originally non-Buddhist teachings that
were adopted by the early Buddhist community and adapted to their own
purpose for showing that these seven forms of purity functioned not as
a goal of practice but as stages along the path to that goal. At any
rate, this list of the seven purities formed the framework for
Buddhaghosa's <i>Visuddhimagga (The Path of Purity),</i> the
cornerstone of his Pali commentaries, in which the seven purities cover
all three parts of the threefold training in virtue, concentration,
&amp; discernment.<!-- TXT_CUT_START --> [<a href="#BM2">Go back</a>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->

<p><b><a name="n3">3</a>.</b> <i>Anupada-parinibbana.</i> The
Commentary gives two interpretations of this term. The first, taking
upadana as <i>clinging,</i> is total Unbinding through lack of
clinging. This, it says, refers to the fact that total Unbinding
follows on the fruit of arahantship, which is devoid of clinging. The
other meaning, taking upadana as <i>sustenance,</i> is total Unbinding
with no sustenance. This, it says, refers to the fact that total
Unbinding is independent of any condition. For an explanation of these
meanings of the word upadana, see The Mind Like Fire Unbound, chapter
3.<!-- TXT_CUT_START --> [<a href="#BM3">Go back</a>]<!-- TXT_CUT_END -->
