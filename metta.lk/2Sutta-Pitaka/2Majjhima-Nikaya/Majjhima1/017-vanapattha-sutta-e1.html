</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>I heard thus:</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>From there the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus, &szlig;Bhikkhus, I will teach the method of the foreat. Listen and attend carefully, I will teach.</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides in a certain forest stretch. When abiding there, unestablished mindfulness does not get established, unconcentrated mind does not concentrate, not destroyed desires do not get destroyed, and the not attained noble end of the yoke is not attained; as for the four requisites of life for the one gone forth, robes, morsel food, dwellings, and requities when ill, are collected with difficulty. That bhikkhu should reflect, `I abide in this forest stretch, to me abiding in this forest, unestablished mindfulness does not get established, unconcentrated mind does not get concentrated, not destroyed desires do not get destroyed, and the not attained noble end of the yoke is not attained; as for the four requisites of life for the one gone forth, robes, morsel food dwellings, and requisites when ill, are collected with difficulty.' Bhikkhus, he should not abide in that stretch of forest, he should leave it by night or by day.</P>
