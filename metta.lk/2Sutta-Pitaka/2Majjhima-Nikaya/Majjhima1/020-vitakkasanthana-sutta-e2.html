<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a
 name="S&agrave;vatthi">S&agrave;vatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a name="anatha">An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika</a>'s
monastery. There he addressed the monks, "Monks!" </p>
<p>"Yes, lord," the monks replied. </p>
<p>The Blessed One said: "When a monk is intent on the heightened mind,
there are five themes he should attend to at the appropriate times.
Which five? </p>
<p>"There is the case where evil, unskillful thoughts -- connected with
desire, aversion, or delusion -- arise in a monk while he is referring
to and attending to a particular theme. He should attend to another
theme, apart from that one, connected with what is skillful. When he is
attending to this other theme, apart from that one, connected with what
is skillful, then those evil, unskillful thoughts -- connected with
desire, aversion, or delusion -- are abandoned and subside. With their
abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it,
and concentrates it. Just as a skilled carpenter or his apprentice
would use a small peg to knock out, drive out, and pull out a large
one; in the same way, if evil, unskillful thoughts -- connected with
desire, aversion, or delusion -- arise in a monk while he is referring
to and attending to a particular theme, he should attend to another
theme, apart from that one, connected with what is skillful. When he is
attending to this other theme, apart from that one, connected with what
is skillful, then those evil, unskillful thoughts -- connected with
desire, aversion, or delusion -- are abandoned and subside. With their
abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it,
and concentrates it. </p>
<p>"<a name="drawbacks">If evil</a>, unskillful thoughts -- connected
with desire, aversion, or delusion -- still arise in the monk while he
is attending to this other theme, connected with what is skillful, he
should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts: 'Truly, these
thoughts of mine are unskillful, these thoughts of mine are
blameworthy, these thoughts of mine result in stress.' As he is
scrutinizing drawbacks of those thoughts, those evil, unskillful
thoughts -- connected with desire, aversion, or delusion -- are
abandoned and subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind
right within, settles it, unifies it, and concentrates it. Just as a
young woman -- or man -- fond of adornment, would be horrified,
humiliated, and disgusted if the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human
being were hung from her neck; in the same way, if evil, unskillful
thoughts -- connected with desire, aversion, or delusion -- still arise
in the monk while he is attending to this other theme, connected with
what is skillful, he should scrutinize the drawbacks of those thoughts:
'Truly, these thoughts of mine are unskillful, these thoughts of mine
are blameworthy, these thoughts of mine result in stress.' As he is
scrutinizing drawbacks of those thoughts, those evil, unskillful
thoughts -- connected with desire, aversion, or delusion -- are
abandoned and subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind
right within, settles it, unifies it, and concentrates it. </p>
<p>"If evil, unskillful thoughts -- connected with desire, aversion or
delusion -- still arise in the monk while he is scrutinizing the
drawbacks of those thoughts, he should pay no mind and pay no attention
to those thoughts. As he is paying no mind and paying no attention to
them, those evil, unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside. With
their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it,
unifies it, and concentrates it. Just as a man with good eyes, not
wanting to see forms that had come into range, would close his eyes or
look away; in the same way, if evil, unskillful thoughts -- connected
with desire, aversion or delusion -- still arise in the monk while he
is scrutinizing the drawbacks of those thoughts, he should pay no mind
and pay no attention to those thoughts. As he is paying no mind and
paying no attention to them, those evil, unskillful thoughts are
abandoned and subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind
right within, settles it, unifies it, and concentrates it. </p>
<p>"If evil, unskillful thoughts -- connected with desire, aversion or
delusion -- still arise in the monk while he is paying no mind and
paying no attention to those thoughts, he should attend to the relaxing
of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts. As he is
attending to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those
thoughts, those evil, unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside.
With their abandoning, he steadies his mind right within, settles it,
unifies it, and concentrates it. Just as the thought would occur to a
man walking quickly, 'Why am I walking quickly? Why don't I walk
slowly?' So he walks slowly. The thought occurs to him, 'Why am I
walking slowly? Why don't I stand?' So he stands. The thought occurs to
him, 'Why am I standing? Why don't I sit down?' So he sits down. The
thought occurs to him, 'Why am I sitting? Why don't I lie down?' So he
lies down. In this way, giving up the grosser posture, he takes up the
more refined one. In the same way, if evil, unskillful thoughts --
connected with desire, aversion or delusion -- still arise in the monk
while he is paying no mind and paying no attention to those thoughts,
he should attend to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to
those thoughts. As he is attending to the relaxing of
thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts, those evil,
unskillful thoughts are abandoned and subside. With their abandoning,
he steadies his mind right within, settles it, unifies it, and
concentrates it. </p>
<p>"If evil, unskillful thoughts -- connected with desire, aversion or
delusion -- still arise in the monk while he is attending to the
relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts, then --
with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his
mouth -- he should beat down, constrain, and crush his mind with his
awareness. As -- with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against
the roof of his mouth -- he is beating down, constraining, and crushing
his mind with his awareness, those evil, unskillful thoughts are
abandoned and subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind
right within, settles it, unifies it, and concentrates it. Just as a
strong man, seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the
shoulders, would beat him down, constrain, and crush him; in the same
way, if evil, unskillful thoughts -- connected with desire, aversion or
delusion -- still arise in the monk while he is attending to the
relaxing of thought-fabrication with regard to those thoughts, then --
with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against the roof of his
mouth -- he should beat down, constrain, and crush his mind with his
awareness. As -- with his teeth clenched and his tongue pressed against
the roof of his mouth -- he is beating down, constraining, and crushing
his mind with his awareness, those evil, unskillful thoughts are
abandoned and subside. With their abandoning, he steadies his mind
right within, settles it, unifies it, and concentrates it. </p>
<p>"Now when a monk...attending to another theme...scrutinizing the
drawbacks of those thoughts...paying no mind and paying no attention to
those thoughts...attending to the relaxing of thought-fabrication with
regard to those thoughts...beating down, constraining and crushing his
mind with his awareness...steadies his mind right within, settles it,
unifies it and concentrates it: He is then called a monk with mastery
over the ways of thought sequences. He thinks whatever thought he wants
to, and doesn't think whatever thought he doesn't. He has severed
craving, thrown off the fetters, and -- through the right penetration
of conceit -- has made an end of suffering and stress." </p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in
the Blessed One's words. </p>
