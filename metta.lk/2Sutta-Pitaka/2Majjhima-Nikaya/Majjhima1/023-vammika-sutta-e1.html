</I>(23) The Simile of the Ant Hill</P>
</B><P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&iuml;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. At that time venerable Kum&agrave;rakassapa lived in the Dark forest. When the night was waning a certain deity illuminated the whole of the Dark forest and approached venerable Kum&agrave;rakassapa stood on a side, and said, Bhikkhu, this ant hill smokes in the night and blazes in the day. The brahmin said</P>
<P>Wise one, take a tool and dig. When digging with the tool he saw an obstacle; Good one, an obstacle. The brahmin said remove the obstacle wise one, and dig with the tool. Digging with the tool he saw a swollen dead body. Good one a swollen dead body. The brahmin said, wise one remove the swollen dead body and dig with the tool. Digging with the tool he saw a forked path. Good one a forked path. The brahmin said, remove the forked path and dig with the tool. Good one a casket. The brahmin said, wise one remove the casket and dig with the tool. Digging with the tool he saw a tortoise. Good one, a tortoise. The brahmin said remove the tortoise and dig with the tool. Digging with the tool he saw a slaughter house. Good one a slaughter house. The brahmin said, wise one remove the slaughter house and dig with the tool.

In this world of gods and men, together with its M&agrave;ras, Brahm&agrave;s and the community of recluses and brahmins I do not see anyone who could answer this question and convince the mind except the Thus Gone One, a disciple of the Thus Gone One or one who has heard it.
