<p>1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at <a
 name="S">S&agrave;vatthi</a> in Jeta's Grove, <a name="anatha">An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika</a>'s
Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." -- "Venerable
sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this: </p>
<p>2. "Bhikkhus, only here is there a recluse, only here a second
recluse, only here a third recluse, only here a fourth recluse. The
doctrines of others are devoid [<a href="#PTSPAGE">*p.64</a>] of
recluses: that is how you should rightly roar your lion's roar.<a
 name="BM1"> </a>[<a href="#n1">1</a>] </p>
<p>3. "It is possible, bhikkhus, that wanderers of other sects might
ask: 'But on the strength of what (argument) or with the support of
what (authority) do the venerable ones say thus?' Wanderers of other
sects who ask thus may be answered in this way: 'Friends, four things
have been declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees,
accomplished and fully enlightened; on seeing these in ourselves we say
thus: "Only here is there a recluse, only here a second recluse, only
here a third recluse, only here a fourth recluse. The doctrines of
others are devoid of recluses." What are the four? We have confidence
in the Teacher, we have confidence in the Dhamma, we have fulfilled the
precepts, and our companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us
whether they are layfolk or those gone forth. These are the four things
declared to us by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and
fully enlightened, on seeing which in ourselves we say as we do.' </p>
<p>4. "It is possible, bhikkhus, that wanderers of other sects might
say thus: 'Friends, we too have confidence in the Teacher, that is, in
our Teacher; we too have confidence in the Dhamma, that is, in our
Dhamma; we too have fulfilled the precepts, that is, our precepts; our
companions in the Dhamma are dear and agreeable to us too whether they
are layfolk or those gone forth. What is the distinction here, friends,
what is the variance, what is the difference between you and us?' </p>
<p>5. "Wanderers of other sects who ask thus may be answered in this
way: 'How then, friends, is the goal one or many?' Answering rightly,
the wanderers of other sects would answer thus: 'Friends, the goal is
one, not many.'<a name="BM2"> </a>[<a href="#n2">2</a>] -- 'But,
friends, is that goal for one affected by lust or free from lust?'
Answering rightly, the wanderers of other sects would answer thus:
'Friends, that goal is for one free from lust, not for one affected by
lust.' -- 'But, friends, is that goal for one affected by hate or free
from hate?' Answering rightly, they would answer: 'Friends, that goal
is for one free from hate, not for one affected by hate.' -- 'But,
friends, is that goal for one affected by delusion or free from
delusion?' Answering rightly, they would answer: 'Friends, that goal is
for one free from delusion, not for one affected by delusion.' -- 'But,
friends, is that goal for one affected by craving or free from
craving?' [<a href="#PTSPAGE">*p.65</a>] Answering rightly, they would
answer: 'Friends, that goal is for one free from craving, not for one
affected by craving.' -- 'But, friends, is that goal for one affected
by clinging or free from clinging?' Answering rightly, they would
answer: 'Friends, that goal is for one free from clinging, not for one
affected by clinging.' -- 'But, friends, is that goal for one who has
vision or for one without vision?' Answering rightly, they would
answer: 'Friends, that goal is for one with vision, not for one without
vision.' -- 'But, friends, is that goal for one who favours and
opposes, or for one who does not favour and oppose?' Answering rightly,
they would answer: 'Friends, that goal is for one who does not favour
and oppose, not for one who favours and opposes.'<a name="BM3"> </a>[<a
 href="#n3">3</a>] -- 'But, friends is that goal for one who delights
in and enjoys proliferation, or for one who does not delight in and
enjoy proliferation?' Answering rightly, they would answer: 'Friends,
that goal is for one who does not delight in and enjoy proliferation,
not for one who delights in and enjoys proliferation.'<a name="BM4"> </a>[<a
 href="#n4">4</a>] </p>
<p>6. "Bhikkhus, <a name="BM2views">there are these two views</a>: the
view of being and the view of non-being. Any recluses or brahmins who
rely on the view of being, adopt the view of being, accept the view of
being, are opposed to the view of non-being. Any recluses or brahmins
who rely on the view of non-being, adopt the view of non-being, accept
the view of non-being, are opposed to the view of being.<a name="BM5"> </a>[<a
 href="#n5">5</a>] </p>
<p>7. "Any recluses or brahmins who do not understand as they actually
are the origin, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger and
the escape <a name="BM6">[</a><a href="#n6">6</a>] in the case of
these two views are affected by lust, affected by hate, affected by
delusion, affected by craving, affected by clinging, without vision,
given to favouring and opposing, and they delight in and enjoy
proliferation. They are not freed from birth, aging and death, from
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair; they are not freed from
suffering, I say. </p>
<p>8. "Any recluses or brahmins who understand as they actually are the
origin, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger and the escape
in the case of these two views are without lust, without hate, without
delusion, without craving, without clinging, with vision, not given to
favouring and opposing, and they do not delight in and enjoy
proliferation. They are freed from birth, aging and death, from sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief and despair; they are freed from suffering, I
say. [<a href="#PTSPAGE">*p.66</a>] </p>
<p>9. "Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of clinging. What four?
Clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to rules and
observances, and clinging to a doctrine of self. </p>
<p>10. "Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full
understanding of all kinds of clinging, they do not completely describe
the full understanding of all kinds of clinging. <a name="BM7">[</a><a
 href="#n7">7</a>] They describe the full understanding of clinging to
sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding of clinging
to views, clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to a doctrine
of self. Why is that? Those good recluses and brahmins do not
understand these three instances of clinging as they actually are.
Therefore, though they claim to propound the full understanding of all
kinds of clinging, they describe only the full understanding of
clinging to sensual pleasures without describing the full understanding
of clinging to views, clinging to rules and observances, and clinging
to a doctrine of self. </p>
<p>11. "Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full
understanding of all kinds of clinging...they describe the full
understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views
without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and
observances and clinging to a doctrine of self. Why is that? They do
not understand two instances...therefore they describe only the full
understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures and clinging to views
without describing the full understanding of clinging to rules and
observances and clinging to a doctrine of self. </p>
<p>12. "Though certain recluses and brahmins claim to propound the full
understanding of all kinds of clinging...they describe the full
understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views, and
clinging to rules and observances without describing the full
understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self. They do not understand
one instance...therefore they describe only the full understanding of
clinging to sensual pleasures, clinging to views, and clinging to rules
and observances without describing the full understanding of clinging
to a doctrine of self. <a name="BM8">[</a><a href="#n8">8</a>] </p>
<p>13. "Bhikkhus, in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that it is plain
that confidence in the Teacher is not rightly directed, that confidence
in the Dhamma is not rightly directed, that fulfilment of the precepts
is not rightly directed, and that the affection among companions in the
Dhamma is not rightly directed. Why is that? Because that is how it is
when the Dhamma and Discipline is [<a href="#PTSPAGE">*p.67</a>] badly
proclaimed and badly expounded, unemancipating, unconducive to peace,
expounded by one who is not fully enlightened. </p>
<p>14. "Bhikkhus, when a Tathagata, accomplished and fully enlightened,
claims to propound the full understanding of all kinds of clinging, he
completely describes the full understanding of all kinds of clinging:
he describes the full understanding of clinging to sensual pleasures,
clinging to views, clinging to rules and observances, and clinging to a
doctrine of self. <a name="BM9">[</a><a href="#n9">9</a>] </p>
<p>15. "Bhikkhus, in such a Dhamma and Discipline as that it is plain
that confidence in the Teacher is rightly directed, that confidence in
the Dhamma is rightly directed, that fulfilment of the precepts is
rightly directed, and that the affection among companions in the Dhamma
is rightly directed. Why is that? Because that is how it is when the
Dhamma and Discipline is well proclaimed and well expounded,
emancipating, conducive to peace, expounded by one who is fully
enlightened. </p>
<p>16. "Now these four kinds of clinging have what as their source,
what as their origin, from what are they born and produced? These four
kinds of clinging have craving as their source, craving as their
origin, they are born and produced from craving.<a name="BM10"> </a>[<a
 href="#n10">10</a>] Craving has what as its source...? Craving has
feeling as its source...Feeling has what as its source...? Feeling has
contact as its source...Contact has what as its source...? Contact has
the sixfold base as its source...The sixfold base has what as its
source...? The sixfold base has mentality-materiality as its
source...Mentality-materiality has what as its source...?
Mentality-materiality has consciousness as its source...Consciousness
has what as its source...? Consciousness has formations as its
source...Formations have what as their source...? Formations have
ignorance as their source, ignorance as their origin; they are born and
produced from ignorance. </p>
<p>17. "Bhikkhus, when ignorance is abandoned and true knowledge has
arisen in a bhikkhu, then with the fading away of ignorance and the
arising of true knowledge he no longer clings to sensual pleasures, no
longer clings to views, no longer clings to rules and observances, no
longer clings to a doctrine of self. <a name="BM11">[</a><a href="#n11">11</a>]
When he does not cling, he is not agitated. When he is not agitated, he
personally attains Nibbana. He understands: 'Birth is destroyed, the
holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is
no more coming to any state of being.'" <a name="BM12">[</a><a
 href="#n12">12</a>] [<a href="#PTSPAGE">*p.68</a>] </p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and
delighted in the Blessed One's words. </p>

<p><b><a name="n1">1</a>.</b> Comy. explains "lion's roar" <i>(sihanada)</i>
as meaning a supreme roar <i>(setthanada),</i> a fearless roar <i>(abhitanada),</i>
and a roar which cannot be confuted <i>(appatinada).</i> It adds: The
roar about the existence of these four types of recluse only here is
the supreme roar. The absence of any fear on account of others when one
advances such a claim makes it a fearless roar. As none of the rival
teachers can rise up and say, "These recluses also exist in our
Dispensation," it is a roar which cannot be confuted. [<a href="#BM1">Go
back</a>] </p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n2">2</a>.</b> Comy.: Even though the adherents of other
sects all declare Arahantship -- understood in a general sense as
spiritual perfection -- to be the goal, they point to other attainments
as the goal in accordance with their views. Thus the brahmins declare
the Brahma-world to be the goal, the great ascetics declare the gods of
Streaming Radiance, the wanderers the gods of Refulgent Glory, and the
Ajivakas the non-percipient state, which they posit to be "infinite
mind" <i>(anantamanasa).</i> [<a href="#BM2">Go back</a>] </p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n3">3</a>.</b> "Favouring and opposing" <i>(anurodha-pativirodha):</i>
reacting with attraction through lust and with aversion through hatred.
[<a href="#BM3">Go back</a>] </p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n4">4</a>.</b> Proliferation (papa&ntilde;ca), according
to Comy., generally means mental activity governed by craving, conceit
and views, but here only craving and views are intended. [<a href="#BM4">Go
back</a>] </p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n5">5</a>.</b> The adoption of one view entailing
opposition to the other links up with the earlier statement that the
goal is for one who does not favour and oppose. [<a href="#BM5">Go back</a>]
</p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n6">6</a>.</b> Comy. mentions eight conditions which
serve as the origin <i>(samudaya)</i> of these views: the five
aggregates, ignorance, contact, perception, thought, unwise attention,
bad friends, and the voice of another. Their disappearance <i>(atthangama)</i>
is the path of stream-entry, which eradicates all wrong views. Their
gratification <i>(assada)</i> may be understood as the satisfaction of
psychological need to which the view caters, specifically the nurturing
of craving for being by the eternalist view and of craving for
non-being by the annihilationist view. Their danger <i>(adinava)</i>
is the continued bondage they entail, by obstructing the acceptance of
right view, which leads to liberation. And the escape from them <i>(nissarana)</i>
is Nibbana. [<a href="#BM6">Go back</a>] </p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n7">7</a>.</b> Comy. glosses full understanding <i>(pari&ntilde;&ntilde;a)</i>
here as overcoming <i>(samatikkama),</i> with reference to the
commentarial notion of <i>pahanapari&ntilde;&ntilde;a,</i> "full
understanding as abandonment." [<a href="#BM7">Go back</a>] </p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n8">8</a>.</b> This passage clearly indicates that the
critical differentiating factor of the Buddha's Dhamma is its "full
understanding of clinging to a doctrine of self." This means, in
effect, that the Buddha alone is able to show how to overcome all views
of self by developing penetration into the truth of non-self <i>(anatta).</i>
[<a href="#BM8">Go back</a>] </p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n9">9</a>.</b> Comy.: The Buddha teaches how clinging to
sense pleasures is abandoned by the path of Arahantship, while the
other three types of clinging are eliminated by the path of
stream-entry. The path of stream-entry eliminates the other three
clingings because these three are all forms of wrong view, and all
wrong views are overcome at that stage. Although the statement that
clinging to sense pleasures is abandoned by the path of Arahantship may
sound strange, in view of the fact that sensual desire is already
eliminated by the non-returner, the Tika (subcommentary) to the sutta
explains that in the present context the word <i>kama,</i> sense
pleasure, should be understood to comprise all forms of greed, and the
subtler types of greed are only eliminated with the attainment of
Arahantship. [<a href="#BM9">Go back</a>] </p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n10">10</a>.</b> This passage is explained in order to
show how clinging is to be abandoned. Clinging is traced back, via the
chain of dependent arising, to its root-cause in ignorance, and then
the destruction of ignorance is shown to be the means to eradicate
clinging. [<a href="#BM10">Go back</a>] </p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n11">11</a>.</b> The Pali idiom, <i>n'eva kamupadanam
upadiyati,</i> would have to be rendered literally as "he does not
cling to the clinging to sense pleasures," which may obscure the sense
more than it illuminates it. The word <i>upadana</i> in Pali is the
object of its own verb form, while "clinging" in English is not. The
easiest solution is to translate directly in accordance with the sense
rather than to try to reproduce the idiom in translation. [<a
 href="#BM11">Go back</a>] </p>
<b></b>
<p><b><a name="n12">12</a>.</b> This is the stock canonical declaration
of Arahantship. [<a href="#BM12">Go back</a>] </p>
