<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was staying at <A NAME="S">S&agrave;vatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="anatha">An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika</A>'s monastery. There he addressed the monks thus: "Monks." -- "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this: </P>
<P>2. "Monks, suppose a cloth were stained and dirty, and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other, whether blue or yellow or red or pink, it would take the dye badly and be impure in colour. And why is that? Because the cloth was not clean. So too, monks, when the mind is defiled,<A NAME="BM1"></A> [</FONT><A HREF="#n1"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">1</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] an unhappy destination [in a future existence] may be expected. </P>

<P>15.

<P>"What good, brahmin, is the Bahuka River? What can the Bahuka River do?" </P>
<P>"Truly, Master Gotama, many people believe that the Bahuka River gives purification, many people believe that the Bahuka River gives merit. For in the Bahuka River many people wash away the evil deeds they have done." </P>
<P>16. Then the Blessed One addressed the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja in these stanzas<A NAME="BM19"></A>: [</FONT><A HREF="#n19"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">19</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>

<P>17. When this was said, the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja spoke thus: </P>
<P>"<A NAME="magnif">Magnificent</A>, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama, as though he were righting the overthrown, revealing the hidden, showing the way to one who is lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. </P>
<P>18. "I go to Master Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha. May I receive the [first ordination of] going forth under Master Gotama, may I receive the full admission! </P>
<P>19. <A NAME="ordain">And the</A> brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja received the [first ordination of] going forth under the Blessed One, and he received the full admission. <A NAME="victory">And not</A> long after his full admission, dwelling alone, secluded, diligent, ardent and resolute, the venerable Bharadvaja by his own realization understood and attained in this very life that supreme goal of the pure life, for which men of good family go forth from home life into homelessness. And he had direct knowledge thus: "Birth is exhausted, the pure life has been lived, the task is done, there is no more of this to come." </P>
<P>And the venerable Bharadvaja became one of the Arahats. </P>

<B><P><A NAME="n1">1</A>.</B> <I>"So too, monks, if the mind is defiled..."</I> Comy: "It may be asked why the Buddha had given this simile of the soiled cloth. He did so to show that effort brings great results. A cloth soiled by dirt that is adventitious (i.e., comes from outside; <I>agantukehi malehi),</I> if it is washed can again become clean because of the cloth's natural purity. But in the case of what is naturally black, as for instance (black) goat's fur, any effort (of washing it) will be in vain. Similarly, the mind too is soiled by adventitious defilements <I>(agantukehi kilesehi).</I> But originally, at the phases of rebirth(-consciousness) and the (sub-conscious) life-continuum, it is pure throughout <I>(pakatiya pana sakale pi patisandhi-bhavanga-vare pandaram eva).</I> As it was said (by the Enlightened One): 'This mind, monks, is luminous, but it becomes soiled by adventitious defilements' (AN I.49). But by cleansing it one can make it more luminous, and effort therein is not in vain." [</FONT><A HREF="#BM1"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Go back</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>
<B><P><A NAME="n2">2</A>.</B> <I>"Defilements of the mind" (cittassa upakkilesa).</I> Comy.: "When explaining the mental defilements, why did the Blessed One mention greed first? Because it arises first. For with all beings wherever they arise, up to the level of the (Brahma heaven of the) Pure Abodes, it is first greed that arises by way of lust for existence <I>(bhava-nikanti).</I> Then the other defilements will appear, being produced according to circumstances. The defilements of mind, however, are not limited to the sixteen mentioned in this discourse. But one should understand that, by indicating here the method, all defilements are included." Sub.Comy. mentions the following additional defilements: fear, cowardice, shamelessness and lack of scruples, insatiability, evil ambitions, etc. [</FONT><A HREF="#BM2"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Go back</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>

<P>The defilements (3) to (16) appear frequently as a group in the discourses, e.g., in Majjh. 3; while in Majjh. 8 (reproduced in this publication) No. 15 is omitted. A list of seventeen defilements appears regularly in each last discourse of Books 3 to 11 of the Anguttara Nikaya, which carry the title <I>Ragapeyyala,</I> the Repetitive Text on Greed (etc.). In these texts of the Anguttara Nikaya, the first two defilements in the above list are called greed <I>(lobha)</I> and hate <I>(dosa),</I> to which delusion <I>(moha)</I> is added; all the fourteen other defilements are identical with the above list. [</FONT><A HREF="#BM3"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Go back</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>
<B><P><A NAME="n4">4</A>.</B> <I>"Knowing covetousness and unrighteous greed to be a defilement of the mind, the monk abandons them."</I> </P>
<I><P>Knowing (viditva).</I> Sub.Comy.: "Having known it either through the incipient wisdom <I>(pubbabhaga-pa&ntilde;&ntilde;a</I> of the worldling, i.e., before attaining to Stream-entry) or through the wisdom of the two lower paths (Stream-entry and Once-returning). He knows the defilements as to their nature, cause, cessation and means of effecting cessation." This application of the formula of the Four Noble Truths to the defilements deserves close attention. </P>
<I><P>Abandons them (pajahati).</I> Comy.: "He abandons the respective defilement through (his attainment of) the noble path where there is 'abandoning by eradication' <I>(samucchedappahana-vasena ariya-maggena),</I>" which according to Sub.Comy. is the "final abandoning" <I>(accantappahana).</I> Before the attainment of the noble paths, all "abandoning" of defilements is of a temporary nature. See Nyanatiloka Thera, <I>Buddhist Dictionary,</I> s.v. <I>pahana.</I> </P>
<P>According to the Comy., the sixteen defilements are finally abandoned by the noble paths (or stages of sanctity) in the following order: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"By the <I>path of Stream-entry (sotapatti-magga)</I> are abandoned: (5) denigration, (6) domineering, (7) envy, (8) jealousy, (9) hypocrisy, (10) fraud. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"<I>By the path of Non-returning (anagami-magga):</I> (2) ill will, (3) anger, (4) malice, (16) negligence. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"<I>By the path of Arahatship (arahatta-magga):</I> (1) covetousness and unrighteous greed, (11) obstinacy, (12) presumption, (13) conceit, (14) arrogance, (15) vanity." </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If, in the last group of terms, covetousness is taken in a restricted sense as referring only to the craving for the five sense objects, it is finally abandoned by the path of Non-returning; and this is according to Comy. the meaning intended here. All greed, however, including the hankering after fine material and immaterial existence, is eradicated only on the path of Arahatship; hence the classification under the latter in the list above. </P>
<P>Comy. repeatedly stresses that wherever in our text "abandoning" is mentioned, reference is to the Non-returner <I>(anagami);</I> for also in the case of defilements overcome on Stream-entry (see above), the states of mind which produce those defilements are eliminated only by the path of Non-returning. [</FONT><A HREF="#BM4"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Go back</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>
<B><P><A NAME="n5">5</A>.</B> Comy. emphasizes the connection of this paragraph with the following, saying that the statements on each of the sixteen defilements should be connected with the next' paragraphs, e.g., "when in him...ill will has been abandoned, he thereupon gains unwavering confidence..." Hence the grammatical construction of the original Pali passage -- though rather awkward in English -- has been retained in this translation. [</FONT><A HREF="#BM5"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Go back</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>
<P>The disciple's direct experience of being freed of this or that defilement becomes for him a living test of his former still imperfectly proven trust in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. Now this trust has become a firm conviction, an unshakable confidence, based on experience. [</FONT><A HREF="#BM5"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Go back</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>
<B><P><A NAME="n6">6</A>.</B> <I>"Unwavering confidence" (aveccappasada).</I> Comy.: "unshakable and immutable trust." Confidence of that nature is not attained before Stream-entry because only at that stage is the fetter of sceptical doubt <I>(vicikiccha-samyojana)</I> finally eliminated. Unwavering confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are three of four characteristic qualities of a Stream-winner <I>(sotapa&ntilde;&ntilde;assa angani);</I> the fourth is unbroken morality, which may be taken to be implied in Sec. 9 of our discourse referring to the relinquishment of the defilements. [</FONT><A HREF="#BM6"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Go back</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>
<B><P><A NAME="n7">7</A>.</B> <I>"When he has given up...(the defilements) in part" (yatodhi):</I> that is, to the extent to which the respective defilements are eliminated by the paths of sanctitude (see </FONT><A HREF="#n4"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Note 4</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">). <I>Odhi:</I> limit, limitation. <I>yatodhi</I> = <I>yato odhi;</I> another reading: <I>yathodhi</I> = <I>yatha-odhi.</I> </P>
<P>Bhikkhu &Ntilde;anamoli translates this paragraph thus: "And whatever (from among those imperfections) has, according to the limitation (set by whichever of the first three paths he has attained), been given up, has been (forever) dropped, let go, abandoned, relinquished. " </P>
<P>In the <I>Vibhanga</I> of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, we read in the chapter <I>Jhana-vibhanga:</I> "He is a bhikkhu because he has abandoned defilements limitedly; or because he has abandoned defilements without limitation" <I>(odhiso kilesanam pahana bhikkhu; anodhiso kilesanam pahana bhikkhu).</I> [</FONT><A HREF="#BM7"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Go back</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>
<B><P><A NAME="n8">8</A>.</B> <I>"Gains enthusiasm for the goal, gains enthusiasm for the Dhamma" (labhati atthavedam labhati dhammavedam).</I> </P>
<P>Comy.: "When reviewing <I>(paccavekkhato)*</I> the abandonment of the defilements and his unwavering confidence, strong joy arises in the Non-returner in the thought: 'Such and such defilements are now abandoned by me.' It is like the joy of a king who learns that a rebellion in the frontier region has been quelled." </P>
<P>* ["Reviewing" <I>(paccavekkhana)</I> is a commentarial term, but is derived, apart from actual meditative experience, from close scrutiny of sutta passages like our present one. "Reviewing" may occur immediately after attainment of the jhanas or the paths and fruitions (e.g., the last sentence of Sec. 14), or as a reviewing of the defilements abandoned (as in Sec. 10) or those remaining. See <I>Visuddhimagga,</I> transl. by &Ntilde;anamoli, p. 789.] </P>
<P>Enthusiasm <I>(veda).</I> According to Comy., the word veda occurs in the Pali texts with three connotations: 1. (Vedic) scripture <I>(gantha),</I> 2. joy <I>(somanassa),</I> 3. knowledge <I>(&ntilde;ana).</I> "Here it signifies joy and the knowledge connected with that joy." </P>
<I><P>Attha</I> (rendered here as "goal") and <I>dhamma</I> are a frequently occurring pair of terms obviously intended to supplement each other. Often they mean letter <I>(dhamma)</I> and spirit (or meaning: <I>attha)</I> of the doctrine; but this hardly fits here. These two terms occur also among the four kinds of analytic knowledge <I>(patisambhida-&ntilde;ana;</I> or knowledge of doctrinal discrimination). <I>Attha-patisambhida</I> is explained as the discriminative knowledge of "the result of a cause"; while <I>dhamma-patisambhida</I> is concerned with the cause or condition. </P>
<P>The Comy. applies now the same interpretation to our present textual passage, saying: <I>"Attha-veda</I> is the enthusiasm arisen in him who reviews his unwavering confidence; <I>dhamma-veda</I> is the enthusiasm arisen in him who reviews 'the abandonment of the defilement in part,' which is the cause of that unwavering confidence..." Hence the two terms refer to "the joy that has as its object the unwavering confidence in the Buddha, and so forth; and the joy inherent in the knowledge (of the abandonment; <I>somanassa-maya &ntilde;ana)."</I> </P>
<P>Our rendering of attha (Skt.:<I>artha)</I> b; "goal" is supported by Comy.: "The unwavering confidence is called <I>attha</I> because it has to be reached <I>(araniyato),</I> i.e., to be approached <I>(upagantabbato),"</I> in the sense of a limited goal, or resultant blessing. </P>
<P>Cf. Ang 5:10: <I>tasmim dhamme attha-patisamvedi ca hoti dhammapatisamvedi ca; tassa atthapatisamvedino dhammapatisamvedino pamojjam jayati...</I> This text continues, as our present discourse does, with the arising of joy (or rapture; <I>piti)</I> from gladness <I>(pamojja).</I> <I>Attha </I>and <I>dhamma</I> refer here to the meaning and text of the Buddha word. [</FONT><A HREF="#BM8"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Go back</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>
<B><P><A NAME="n9">9</A>.</B> The Pali equivalents for this series of terms* are: 1. <I>pamojja </I>(gladness), 2. <I>piti</I> (joy or rapture), 3. <I>passaddhi</I> (tranquillity), 4. <I>sukha</I> (happiness), 5. <I>samadhi</I> (concentration). Nos. 2, 3, 5 are factors of enlightenment <I>(bojjhanga).</I> The function of tranquillity is here the calming of any slight bodily and mental unrest resulting from rapturous joy, and so transforming the latter into serene happiness followed by meditative absorption. This frequently occurring passage illustrates the importance given in the Buddha's Teaching to happiness as a necessary condition for the attainment of concentration and of spiritual progress in general. </P>

Why then the fishes and the tortoises,<BR>
The frogs, the watersnake, the crocodiles<BR>
And all that haunt the water straight to heaven<BR>
Will go. Yea, all who evil kamma work -- <BR>
Butchers of sheep and swine, fishers, hunters of game,<BR>
Thieves, murderers -- so they but splash themselves<BR>
With water, are from evil kamma free! </BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>
