<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>1. Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was staying at <A NAME="S">S&agrave;vatthi</A>, in Jeta's Grove, <A NAME="anatha">An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika</A>'s monastery. </P>
<P>2. Then one evening the venerable <A NAME="cunda">Maha-Cunda</A> <A NAME="BM1"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n1">1</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] rose from meditative seclusion and went to the Blessed One. Having paid homage to him, he sat down at one side and spoke thus to the Blessed One: </P>
<P>3. "Venerable sir, there are these various views that arise in the world concerning self-doctrines or world-doctrines.<A NAME="BM2"></A> [</FONT><A HREF="#n2"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">2</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] Does the abandoning and discarding of such views come about in a monk who is only at the beginning of his [meditative] reflections?" [<A NAME="BM3"></FONT><A HREF="#n3">3</A></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>
<P>"Cunda, as to those several views that arise in the world concerning self-doctrines and world-doctrines, if [the object] in which [<A NAME="BM4"></FONT><A HREF="#n4">4</A></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] these views arise, in which they underlie and become active, [<A NAME="BM5"></FONT><A HREF="#n5">5</A></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] is seen with right wisdom<A NAME="BM6"></A> [</FONT><A HREF="#n6">6</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] as it actually is, <A NAME="BM7"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n7">7</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] thus: 'This is not mine, <A NAME="BM8"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n8">8</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] this I am not, <A NAME="BM9"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n9">9</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] this is not my self' <A NAME="BM10"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n10">10</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] -- then the abandoning of these views, their discarding, <A NAME="BM11"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n11">11</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] takes place in him [who thus sees]. </P>
<B><P>The Eight Attainments</B> <BR>
4. "It may be, Cunda, that some monk, detached from sense-objects, detached from unsalutary ideas, enters into the first absorption that is born of detachment, accompanied by thought-conception and discursive thinking, and filled with rapture and joy, and he then might think: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these [attainments] that are called 'effacement'; in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now.' <A NAME="BM12"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n12">12</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>
<P>5. "It may be that after the stilling of thought conception and discursive thinking, he gains the inner tranquillity and harmony of the second absorption that is free of thought-conception and discursive thinking, born of concentration and filled with rapture and joy; and he then might think: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these [attainments] that are called 'effacement'; in the Noble One's discipline they are caged 'abidings in ease here and now.' </P>
<P>6. "It may be that after the fading away of rapture, the monk dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly aware, and he experiences a happiness in his body of which the Noble Ones say: 'Happily lives he who dwells in equanimity and is mindful!' -- that third absorption he wins; and he then might think: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these [attainments] that are called 'effacement'; in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now.' </P>
<P>7. "It may be that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, he enters upon and abides in the fourth absorption, which is beyond pleasure and pain and has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity; and he then might think: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these [attainments] that are called 'effacement'; in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'abidings in ease here and now.' </P>
<P>8. "It may be that, with the entire transcending of perceptions of corporeality, <A NAME="BM13"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n13">13</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] with the disappearance of perceptions of sense-response,' <A NAME="BM14"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n14">14</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] with non-attention to perceptions of variety,<A NAME="BM15"></A> [</FONT><A HREF="#n15">15</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] thinking: 'Space is infinite,' some monk enters upon and abides in the sphere of infinite space; and he then might think: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these [attainments] that are called 'effacement'; in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings.' </P>
<P>9. "It may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite space, thinking: 'Consciousness is infinite,' some monk enters and abides in the sphere of infinite consciousness; and he then might think: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these [attainments] that are called 'effacement'; in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings.' </P>
<P>10. "It may be that by entirely transcending the sphere of infinite consciousness, some monk enters and abides in the sphere of nothingness; and he then might think: I am abiding in effacement.' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these [attainments] that are called 'effacement'; in the Noble One's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings.' </P>
<P>11. "It may be that, by entirely transcending the sphere of nothingness, some monk enters and abides in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; and he then might think: 'I am abiding in effacement.' But in the Noble One's discipline it is not these [attainments] that are called 'effacement'; in the Noble one's discipline they are called 'peaceful abidings.' </P>

The beginner's insight-practice extends from the "discernment of mentality and corporeality" <I>(namarupa-pariccheda)</I> up to the "knowledge of rise and fall" <I>(udayabbaya-&ntilde;ana),</I> on which see <I>Path of Purification</I> <I>(Visuddhimagga),</I> Chs. XVIII, XX, XXI. </P>
<P>According to the Comy., the Thera's question concerns those who overrate the degree of their achievement, i.e., those who believe that, in their meditative practice, they have achieved this or that result while actually they have not. Overestimation <I>(abhimana),</I> in that sense, "does not arise in ignorant common people <I>(bala-puthujjana)</I> who are entirely engrossed in worldly life, nor does it arise in Noble Disciples <I>(ariya-savaka);</I> because in a Stream-winner the overestimation does not arise that he is a Once-returner, etc. Self-overestimation can occur only in one who actually practices (meditation) and has temporarily subdued the defilements by way of tranquillity or insight. Maha-Cunda Thera, being an Arahat, was no self-overrater himself, but in formulating his question, he put himself in the place of one who is; or, as others say, there may have been such "self-overraters" among his pupils, and for conveying to them the Buddha's reply, he put his question.

<P>* [<I>Sallekha (= sam-lekha)</I> is derived from the verbal root <I>likh,</I> to scratch; hence <I>likhati</I> (a) to scratch in, to write; (b) to scratch off, to remove: <I>samlikhati,</I> "to remove fully." An interesting parallel is <I>"ascesis,"</I> derived from the Greek <I>askeuein,</I> to scratch. The rendering by "effacement" is &Ntilde;anamoli Thera's; Soma Thera has "cancelling"; I. B. Horner, "expunging."] </P>
<P>The eight stages of meditation given here in the discourse, consist of the four fine-material absorptions <I>(rupajjhana)</I> and the four immaterial absorptions <I>(arupajjhana).</I> Comy. says that these meditative attainments "are in common with the ascetics outside (the Buddha's Dispensation)." </P>
<P>Comy.: "The overrater's meditative absorption is neither 'effacement' nor is it the 'path of practice for effacement' <I>(sallekha-patipada).</I> And why not? Because that jhana is not used by him as a basis for insight; that is, after rising from jhana he does not scrutinise the (physical and mental) formations" (see <I>Visuddhimagga</I> transl. by &Ntilde;anamoli, Ch. XVIII, 3). His jhana produces only one-pointedness of mind, and is, as our text says, an "abiding in ease here and now."

<B><P><A NAME="n17">17</A>.</B> Comy.: "Harmlessness is called 'effacement,' because it effaces harmfulness, i.e., it cuts it off <I>(chindati).</I> This method of explanation applies to all other terms." </P>
<P>Sub.Comy.: "But why is harmlessness (or nonviolence, <I>ahimsa)</I> mentioned at the very beginning? Because it is the root of all virtues; harmlessness, namely, is a synonym of compassion. Especially, it is the root-cause of morality because it makes one refrain from immorality which has as its characteristic mark the harming of others. Just as the killing of living beings has the harming of others as its mark, so also the taking away of others' property; for 'robbing a man's wealth is worse than stabbing him.'* Similarly, chastity removes the cause for the pains of child bearing, etc., and there is hardly a need to mention the harm done by adultery. </P>
<P>* [This is given in Pali as direct speech or quote; perhaps it was a common adage.] </P>
<P>"Obvious is also the harm done to others by deception, by causing dissension and by backbiting. The mark of harming others is also attached to gossip because it takes away what is beneficial and causes to arise what is not beneficial; to covetousness, as it causes one to take what is not given; to ill will, as it causes killing, etc.; to wrong views, as they are the cause of all that is un-beneficial. One who holds wrong views may, in the conviction of acting righteously, kill living beings and incite others to do likewise. There is nothing to say about other (and lesser immoral acts induced by false views). </P>
<P>"Harmlessness (i.e., the principle of non-violence) has the characteristic mark of making one refrain from immorality which, on its part, has the mark of harming. Hence harmlessness is an especially strong productive cause of morality; and morality, again, is the basis for concentration of mind, while concentration is the basis for wisdom. In that way harmlessness (non-violence) is the root of all virtues. </P>
<P>"Furthermore, in the case of the highest type of men <I>(uttamapurisa)</I> who have noble aspirations, who act considerately and wisely, also their mental concentration and their wisdom, just as their morality, is conducive to the weal and happiness of others. In that way, too, compassion is the root of all virtues, and therefore it has been mentioned at the beginning. </P>
<P>"Now, (after harmlessness), the salutary courses of action <I>(kusala-kammapatha;</I> 2-11) are to show that these states are produced by harmlessness. Then follow the eight states of rightness (11-18) to show that they must be brought about by basing them on morality, which is the root of these virtues. Now the separation from the hindrances (21-23, and 16, 17) is included to indicate that this is the primary task for one intent on purifying (his practice of) the eightfold path. Then follows the cleansing from the defilements (24-33) to indicate that effacement is accomplished by giving up anger (24), etc. And the cleansing from the defilements will be successful when aided by amenability to advice, noble friendship and heedful diligence (34-36). </P>
<P>"Now the seven noble qualities (37-43) are included to show that they will come to perfection in him who is endowed with amenability and the other (two factors); and that they, on their part, after having strengthened insight, will lead to the paths of sanctitude. (</FONT><A HREF="#n16"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">See end of Note 16.</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">) </P>
<P>"Finally, the passage on 'misapprehending according to one's individual views,' etc. (44) is meant to indicate that for such a one (i.e., for one bent on effacement) that wrong attitude is an obstacle to the attainment of the supramundane virtues and is, therefore, to be avoided totally. This passage on misapprehending (about which </FONT><A HREF="#n18"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">see Note 18</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">) is also meant to show that one who, by the right conduct here described, is in the process of attaining one of the paths of sanctitude, win be led to the acme of effacement (by this last-mentioned threefold way of effacement). </P>
<P>"In this manner should be understood the purpose of stating these forty-four modes of effacement as well as the order in which they appear in the discourse." [</FONT><A HREF="#BM17"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Go back</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] </P>

Even if the Buddhas or others show them reasons, they do not relinquish their views. Such people, whatever idea they conceive, be it in accordance with Dhamma or not, will say: 'So it has been told by our teacher. So we have learned it'; and they will withdraw into themselves like a turtle drawing its limbs into its shell.

<P>Comy. says that a salutary thought is of great importance as it leads entirely to weal and happiness, and as it is the cause for the subsequent actions conforming to it.

The Sub.Comy., however, says that in some cases the importance is not in the thought itself but only in the actual execution of it. This certainly applies to the intention to give alms, etc. But in the efforts for effacing the defilements, the formation of a mental attitude directed towards it, in other words, the heart's resolve, is certainly an important factor. </P>
