<P>&szlig;</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">I heard thus.</P>
<P>&szlig;At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapindika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. From there venerable S&agrave;riputta addressed the bhikkhus:</P>
<P>&szlig;&szlig;Friends, bhikkhus, it is said, `Right view; the view, rectified, endowed with unwavering faith in the Teaching, how does the noble disciple come to this good Teaching?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;"Friend, we came from afar to hear the meaning of these words from venerable S&agrave;riputta, good that the meaning occurs to venerable S&agrave;riputta, hearing it from venerable S&agrave;riputta, the bhikkhus will bear it in mind."</P>
<P>&szlig;"Then listen carefully and attend. When the noble disciple knows demerit and its roots, merit and its roots, with this much, the view rectified, endowed with unwavering faith in the Teaching, he comes to this good Teaching.</P>
<P>&szlig;Friends, what is demerit, and what are the roots of demerit? Destroying life is demerit, taking the not given is demerit, misbehaviour in sensuality is demerit, telling lies is demerit, slandering is demerit, rough talk is demerit, frivolous talk is demerit, coveting is demerit, bearing the angry mind is demerit, and wrong view is demerit. These are demerit.</P>
<P>&szlig;What are the roots of demerit? Greed is a root of demerit, anger is a root of demerit, and delusion is a root of demerit. These are the roots of demerit.</P>
<P>&szlig;What is merit? Abstaining from destroying life is merit. Abstaining from taking what is not given is merit. Abstaining from misbehaviour in sensuality is merit. Abstaining from telling lies is merit. Abstaining from slandering is merit. Abstaining from rough talk is merit. Abstaining from frivolous talk is merit. Abstaining from coveting is merit. Not bearing an angry mind is merit and right view is merit. These are merit.</P>
<P>&szlig;What are the roots of merit? Non-greed is a root of merit. Non-hate is a root of merit. And non-delusion is a root of merit. These are the roots of merit. When the noble disciple knows demerit and roots of demerit, merit and roots of merit, he gives up all latent tendencies to greed, drives out all latent tendencies to aversion, and completly destroying the latent tendency to measure as `I be', dispels ignorance, arouses science, and here and now makes an end of unpleasantness. With this much, the view rectified, endowed with unwavering faith in the Teaching, comes to this good Teaching.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Those bhikkhus, accepting and delighting in the words of venerable S&agrave;riputta asked, &szlig;Friend, is there another method by which the noble disciple would rectify his view, be endowed with unwavering faith in the Teaching and would come to this good Teaching?&ucirc;</P>

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P><A NAME="n1"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#BM1">1</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] Mental cognition is the third: `<I>manos~ncetan&agrave; tatiyo</I>'.

<P><A NAME="n2"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#BM2">2</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] These three are the beings: <I>`tayo 'me &agrave;vuso bhav&agrave;</I>'. Being is the mind's behaviour in sensual thoughts, thinking about material and maintaining the mind in immaterial states.</P>
<P><A NAME="n3"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#BM3">3</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] These four are the holdings: <I>`catt&agrave;ro 'me &agrave;vuso up&agrave;d&agrave;n&agrave;</I>'. This holding is something done with the mind. This fourfold holding consists of holding to sensuality, holding to views, holding to virtues, and holding to a self view (<I>tanh&agrave; paccay&agrave; up&agrave;d&agrave;na, up&agrave;d&agrave;na paccay&agrave; bhava</I>). The three links (craving, holding, and being) are mental links just before a birth. It's a birth of a thought. Craving starts at one or other of the mental spheres, i.e., through seeing, hearing, etc, and then the mental hold of it and being with it. This is a very subtle, quick procedure and it is very difficult to be observed.</P>

According to the Cuulavedalla Sutta (M. 44), Bhikkhuni Dhammadinn&agrave; explains it thus: bodily determinations are in- and out-breaths, as they are bound up with the body; without them the body would not function. Verbal determinations are thinking and pondering. Words always follow thinking and pondering. So thinking and pondering are verbal determinations. Mental determinations are perceptions and feelings; as perceptions and feelings are bound up with the mind, they are mental determinations.</P>

These desires arise at one or the other of the mental spheres; that is, by seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, or cognizing with the mind. The ignorance that arises is to take those desires as permanent, agreeabale, and as &szlig;mine&ucirc;. To dispel ignorance one has to dispel the view that these desires are permanent, agreeable, and &szlig;they are mine&ucirc;.</P>
