<P>5. &szlig;Bhikkhus, in the past, in this same Rajagaha there was a poor miserable beggar.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;He trained himself and gained in faith, virtues, learning, benevolence and wisdom in the dispensation, declared by the Thus Gone Ones.</P>
<P>7. &szlig;And after death he was born in the company of the gods of the thirty-three. In the midst of the gods of the thirty-three, he out shone in beauty and fame.</P>
<P>8. &szlig;The gods of the thirty-three were irritated and annoyed seeing him, thought it is wonderful and surprising this son of the gods in the past was a poor miserable beggar. After death he is born in heaven in the company of the thirty-three and out shines the other gods in beauty and fame.</P>

And after death he was born in the company of the gods of the thirty-three. In the midst of the gods of the thirty-three, he out shines in beauty and fame.'</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Then Sakka the king of gods in a friendly manner said these stanzas to the gods of the thirty-three:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>`If someone's faith is unwaveringly established,<BR>
In the dispensation of the Thus Gone Ones,<BR>
If his virtues are pure and praised by the noble ones,<BR>
And faith in the Community of bhikkhus is established,<BR>
If he has rectified his view, it is said he is not poor<BR>
His life is auspicious. Therefore wisely grow in,<BR>
Faith, virtues and appreciating right view<BR>
