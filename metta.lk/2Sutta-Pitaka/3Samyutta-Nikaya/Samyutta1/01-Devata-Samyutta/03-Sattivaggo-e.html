<P>1. 3. 1.</P>
<P>(21) Sattiya &Yacute; With a Sword</P>
<P>I heard thus. Once the Blessed One lived in S&agrave;vatthi, in Jeta's grove in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika. When the night was waning, a certain deity illuminating the whole of Jeta's grove approached the Blessed One worshipped, stood on a side and said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;As though tormented, touching the top, with a sword<BR>
The bhikkhu does the recluseship mindfully to dispel sensual greed.&ucirc;</P>
<P>As though tormented, touching the top with a sword<BR>
The bhikkhu does the recluseship mindfully to dispel the deluded view of a self.&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 3. 2.</P>
<P>(22) Phusati &Yacute; Hurting</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Hurting those who do not hurt, the one who hurts, is hurt,<BR>
Therefore, by hurting those who should not be hurt, the hurter is hurt.</P>
<P>If someone hurts a pure man without blemish,<BR>
That foolish man feels his own demerit, like fine sand thrown against the wind.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 3. 3.</P>
<P>(23) Ja&ntilde;&agrave; &Yacute; A Tangle</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;The internal and the external are tangled. The populace is entangled.<BR>
I ask Gotama, who would disentangle this entangle?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;A wise man established in virtues, develops his mind and wisdom<BR>
And that zealous and clever bhikkhu, disentangles, the tangle.<BR>
In whomever greed, hate and delusion are dispelled,<BR>
That worthy one, whose desires are destroyed, has disentangled it.<BR>
&szlig;When name and matter is pulled out without anything remaining,<BR>
And also anger and material perceptions, then too it is disentangled.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 3. 4.</P>
<P>(24) Mano-niv&agrave;ran&agrave; &Yacute; Restraint of The Mind</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;If someone restrains his mind when the need arises, <BR>
By that, unpleasantness does not come to him.<BR>
If his mind is always restrained, <BR>
He is released from all unpleasantness.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;If the mind is not restrained always, <BR>
It has not reached the highest good.<BR>
Whenever demerit rises, <BR>
Then and there restrain the mind.&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<P>(25) Araham &Yacute; The Worthy</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;A bhikkhu, who has done his duty as a worthy one <BR>
Having destroyed desires, bears the last body<BR>
He may say, `I say' or others `say it's to me' <BR>
A bhikkhu, who has done his duty as a worthy one <BR>
Having destroyed desires, bears the last body<BR>
May say, `I say' or others `say it's to me' <BR>
Clever in the ways of expression in the world,<BR>
He would say it, wanting to convey the meaning <BR>
A bhikkhu, who has done his duty as a worthy one <BR>
Having destroyed desires, bears the last body<BR>
Has overcome measuring, He may say, `I say' or others `say it's to me'<BR>
There are no bonds to one, who has dispelled measuring,<BR>
He has dispelled all signs of measuring<BR>
The wise one has overcome all thinking what so ever. <BR>
He may say, `I say' or others `say it's to me' <BR>
Clever in the ways of expression in the world,<BR>
He would say it, wanting to convey the meaning.&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<P>(26) Pajjoto &Yacute; Light</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;How many lights are there, in the world to illuminate it?<BR>
We ask this from the good one.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;In the world, there are four lights, a fifth is not evident<BR>
During the day the sun burns and the moon shines at night<BR>
Fire burns here and there, day and night<BR>
Of illuminations, the all knowing one's light is foremost and incomparable.&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<P>1. 3. 7.</P>
<P>(27) Sar&agrave; &Yacute; Movement</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Where does the movement stop? How does the rolling stop?<BR>
How are name and matter annihilated without anything remaining?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Wherever water, earth, fire and air have no footing<BR>
There, movement stops and the rolling stops<BR>
There name and matter is annihilated without anything remaining.&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 3. 8.</P>
<P>(28) Mahadhan&agrave; &Yacute; Great Wealth</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Even the wealthy, resourceful worriers; landowners,<BR>
Become greedy for each others wealth, not caring for sensuality<BR>
Make endeavor following the desire `to be'.<BR>
Some give up greed and craving, don't make endeavor in this world?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Giving up home, becoming homeless, give up, sons and herds.<BR>
They dispel greed, hate and delusion and destroy desires.<BR>
Become worthy, do not make endeavor in the world.</P></DIR>

<P>1. 3. 9.</P>
<P>(29) Catucakka &Yacute; Four Wheels</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Born from dust we are four wheels, nine entrances<BR>
And merit mixed with greed.<BR>
Hero, how should we proceed?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Cut, interest, the straps, desires, greed and demerit,<BR>
Also uproot craving completely and then proceed.&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<P>(30) Enijangha &Yacute; Limbed like an antelope</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Has the limbs of an antelope, is thin and heroic,<BR>
Partakes little food without indulging,<BR>
Roams like a lion, like an elephant does not desire sensuality,<BR>
Approaching ask, how should we end unpleasantness?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;In the world, there are five strands of sensuality and mind is the sixth.<BR>
Dispelling the interest for them, should be released from unpleasantness.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
