<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 5. 1.</P>
<P>(41) &acirc;dittam &Yacute; On Fire</P>
<P>Thus I heard. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>A certain deity, when the night was waning illuminating the whole of Jeta's grove with an effulgent light approached the Blessed One, worshipped and stood on a side.</P>
<P>Standing on a side, that deity pronounced these stanzas in the presence of the Blessed One:</P>
<P>&szlig;When the house is on fire, things given away,<BR>
Are important, the rest get burnt with the house.<BR>
Thus our forefathers were carried away by decay and death,<BR>
And whatever they gave got established for them.<BR>
The given brought pleasant results, the not given was left behind,<BR>
Robbers or kings took them, or it was destroyed by fire.<BR>
At the end the body is burnt with all its belongings,<BR>
Knowing this the wise partake and give their wealth<BR>
By partaking and giving in their capacity<BR>
Without blame procure a place in heaven.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 5. 2.</P>
<P>(42) Kimdada &Yacute; Giving What?</P>
<P>&szlig;Giving what is giving strength? Giving what is giving beauty?<BR>
Giving what is giving pleasantness? Giving what is giving sight?<BR>
Who gives everything? May I know about this?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Giving food is giving strength.<BR>
Giving clothing is giving beauty.<BR>
Giving conveyances is giving pleasantness<BR>
And giving light is giving sight<BR>
He that gives a dwelling gives everything.<BR>
And advising according to the Teaching,<BR>
One gives the deathless state.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 5. 3.</P>
<P>(43) Annam &Yacute; Food</P>
<P>&szlig;Gods and men, revel partaking food.<BR>
Yet this non-human does not enjoy food?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;He that bestows him food out of faith, with a pleasant mind<BR>
That same he shares in this and the other world<BR>
Therefore if gifts are given overcoming the stains of miserliness<BR>
The merit establishes beings, well in the other world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 5. 4.</P>
<P>(44) Ekamuul&agrave; &Yacute; A Single Root</P>
<P>&szlig;The sage crossed the abyss with a single root two turns<BR>
Three stains, five stones and the ocean with twelve eddies.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 5. 5.</P>
<P>(45) Anomiya &Yacute; Has No Name.</P>
<P>&szlig;His name is Anoma, he sees subtle meanings<BR>
Gives wisdom without clinging to sensuality<BR>
Look at the sage wise in all matters,<BR>
He proceeds along the path of the noble ones.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 5. 6.</P>
<P>(46) Acchar&agrave; &Yacute; For The Snapping of the Finger.</P>
<P>&szlig;With the snapping of the finger, the demons are associated,<BR>
At the end of the forest is the enticement, how is this done?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Upright, is the name of the path, no fear is the direction.<BR>
Not crooked is the name of the chariot with the eye of the Teaching.<BR>
Shame is the brakes and the accessories are mindfulness.<BR>
Charioteer I say is the Teaching and right view, the attendant<BR>
If any woman or man goes in this direction,<BR>
He reaches close up to extinction in this vehicle.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 5. 7.</P>
<P>(47) Vanarop&agrave; &Yacute; Forestation</P>
<P>&szlig;Whose wisdom grows constantly day and night?<BR>
Which virtuous people live righteously and go to heaven?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;They who grow orchards, forests, and make bridges,<BR>
They who provide water for drinking and give dwellings<BR>
Their wisdom grows constantly day and night.<BR>
Those virtuous people living righteously go to heaven.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 5. 8.</P>
<P>(48) Jetavana &Yacute; Jeta's Grove.</P>
<P>&szlig;This Jeta's grove, home of many sages,<BR>
And inhabited by the king of righteousness, arouses joy in me.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Beings who have to die, are purified by actions, knowledge, righteousness,<BR>
Virtues and noble livelihood, not by birth or wealth<BR>
Therefore the wise for their own welfare<BR>
Penetrate into the Teaching and purify their selves<BR>
In wisdom, virtues and appeasement like S&agrave;riputta,<BR>
Of those bhikkhus who have crossed over, he is the foremost.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>1. 5. 9.</P>
<P>(49) Macchar&atilde; &Yacute; Miserly</P>
<P>&szlig;In this world there are the miserly, greedy and the revilers<BR>
They destroy gifts given to others. What results do they reap?<BR>
And where do they go hereafter? We came to know about this.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;The miserly, greedy and the revilers, who destroy gifts given to others<BR>
Are reborn in hell, as animals or the underworld<BR>
If reborn as humans would be in a poor clan,<BR>
Clothes, scraps of food, amusement and play, from wherever<BR>
They gain with difficulty, when others see them as foolish,<BR>
That too they will not gain.<BR>
These are results here and now and decrease hereafter.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Now we know this. And ask another question:<BR>
If a benevolent one, free from miserliness is born in this world,<BR>
With unwavering faith in the enlightenment, Teaching<BR>
And the Community of bhikkus, what results, does he reap in this world and hereafter?<BR>
We want to know this too.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;If a benevolent one free from miserliness is born in this world,<BR>
With unwavering faith in the enlightenment, Teaching<BR>
And the Community of bhikkhus<BR>
Where he is born, explains the heaven.<BR>
If born as a human in this world,<BR>
Will be born in a wealthy family with resources<BR>
Clothes, scraps of food, amusement and play, he will gain without difficulty.<BR>
And he will enjoy the wealth amassed by others, as if it was his own.<BR>
These are results here and now and increase, hereafter.&ucirc;</P>
