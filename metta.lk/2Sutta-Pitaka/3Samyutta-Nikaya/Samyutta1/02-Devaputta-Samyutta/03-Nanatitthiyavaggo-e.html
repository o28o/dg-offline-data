<P>(21) Sivo &Yacute; Siva the Son of the Gods</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. Once the Blessed One lived in S&agrave;vatthi in Jeta's grove in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika.</P>
<P>When the night was waning Siva the son of gods approached the Blessed One, illuminating the complete Jeta's grove, worshiped the Blessed One and stood on a side and said thus in the presence of the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Associate all and become intimate with all,<BR>
Know the right Teaching of Great Men. It's not demerit, it's for well being.<BR>
Associate all and become intimate with all,<BR>
Know the right Teaching of Great Men. It's gaining wisdom for extinction.<BR>
&szlig;Associate all and become intimate with all<BR>
Know the right Teaching of Great Men. It's not grieving, among the grief stricken.<BR>
Associate all and become intimate with all.<BR>
Know the right Teaching of Great Men. It's shining amidst your relations.<BR>
Associate all and become intimate with all,<BR>
Know the right Teaching of Great Men. Thus beings are born in heaven.<BR>
Associate all and become intimate with all,<BR>
Know the right Teaching of Great Men. By that beings stay pleasant.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>9. Then the Blessed One said this stanza to Siva the son of gods:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Associate all and become intimate with all,<BR>
Know the right Teaching of Great Men, and be released from all unpleasantness.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. 3. 2.</P>
<P>(22) Khemo &Yacute; Khema the Son of Gods</P>
<P>Khema, the son of gods standing on a side said this stanza, to the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;The foolish behave, becoming their own enemy<BR>
They do actions, the results of which are painful.<BR>
Actions that bring remorse are better not done<BR>
The results of such actions are to be borne with tearful eyes.<BR>
Actions without remorse are well done.<BR>
Their results could be enjoyed with a pleasant mind.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;With caution do actions, if you know it's for your welfare.<BR>
Do not think like a carter, think wisely to exert.<BR>
Do not be like the carter who abandoned the safe highway,<BR>
Entered the uneven path and gambled in thoughts.<BR>
Just so leaving behind the Teaching, do not pick up the wrong Teaching.<BR>
The fool in the face of death thinks like a loser in gambling.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. 3. 3.</P>
<P>(23) Seri &Yacute; Seri the Son of Gods</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1. &szlig;Gods and men, enjoy partaking food.<BR>
Yet this non-human does not enjoy food?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;If food is bestowed to him out of faith, with a pleasant mind<BR>
That merit, the giver shares in this and the other world<BR>
Therefore give gifts to overcome,<BR>
the stains of miserliness.<BR>
Merit establishes beings, well in the other world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>2. Seri the son of the gods said to the Blessed One: <BR>
&szlig;Indeed, venerable sir, your words, are wonderful.</P>
<P>&szlig;If food is bestowed to him, out of faith, with a pleasant mind<BR>
That merit, the giver shares in this and the other world<BR>
Therefore give gifts to overcome the stains of miserliness<BR>
Merit establishes beings, well in the other world.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>3. &szlig;Venerable sir, in the past there was a king named Seri. He was a benefactor, who praised giving gifts. That was me, I gave gifts at the four entrances to recluses, Brahmins, beggars, wayfarers and tramps.</P>
<P>4. Venerable sir, when I approached the women's quarters they said: &szlig;Gifts of the lord are given, our gifts are not given. Good! If we too give gifts because of our lord and make merit.</P>
<P>5. Venerable sir, then it occurred to me, I am a benefactor, I praise giving gifts. When they say, we want to give gifts, what shall I do? I gave the first entrance to the queens in the harem. There the queens gave gifts and my gifts were put aside</P>
<P>6. Venerable sir, then I approached the subordinate warrior kings, they said: &szlig;Gifts of me'lord are given, gifts of the ladies in the harem are given, our gifts are not given. Good! If we too give gifts because of our lord and make merit.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, then it occurred to me, I am a benefactor, I praise giving gifts. When they say, we want to give gifts, what shall I do? I gave the second entrance to the subordinate warrior kings. There, the sub ordinate warrior kings gave gifts and my gifts were put aside</P>
<P>7. Venerable sir, then I approached the forces they said: &szlig;Gifts of me'lord are given, gifts of the queens are given, gifts of the warrior subordinates are given, our gifts are not given. Good! If we too give gifts because of our lord and make merit.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, then it occurred to me, I am a benefactor, I praise giving gifts. When they say, we want to give gifts, what shall I do? I gave the third entrance to the forces. There the forces gave gifts and my gifts were put aside</P>
<P>8. Venerable sir, then I approached the Brahmin householders they said: &szlig;Gifts of me'lord are given, gifts of the queens are given, gifts of the warrior subordinates are given, gifts of the forces are given, our gifts are not given. Good! If we too give gifts because of our lord and make merit.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, then it occurred to me, I am a benefactor, I praise giving gifts. When they say, we want to give gifts, what shall I do? I gave the fourth entrance to the Brahmin householders. There the Brahmin householders gave gifts and my gifts were put aside</P>
<P>9. Then I approached the general public and they said, the gifts of the king are not given anywhere</P>
<P>Then, venerable sir, I said to those people: &szlig;Friends, of the wealth arising from the external states, give half to the treasury and with the other half give gifts to recluses, Brahmins, beggars, wayfarers and tramps.</P>
<P>10. Venerable sir, giving gifts and doing merit in this manner, I can not measure the magnitude of the merits and there results, as it is this much and this much and would have to enjoy heavenly bliss for such a length of time.</P>
<P>11. Indeed, venerable sir, your words, are wonderful.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;If food is bestowed to him, out of faith, with a pleasant mind<BR>
That merit, the giver shares in this and the other world<BR>
Therefore give gifts to overcome the stains of miserliness<BR>
Merit establishes beings, well in the other world.&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. 3. 4.</P>
<P>(24) Gha&ntilde;&ntilde;hikaro &Yacute; Gha&ntilde;&ntilde;ikara the Son of the Gods</P>
<P>1. Standing on a side, Gha&ntilde;&ntilde;h&atilde;kara the son of the gods said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Seven bhikkhus, destroyed greed and hatred,<BR>
Crossed the diffused ness of the world,<BR>
And took birth, as Aviha Brahmas.</P>
<P>2. How did they cross the difficult domains of death?<BR>
How did they give up the human bodies and gain heavenly ones?</P>
<P>3. The three Upaka, Phalaga&otilde;.da and Pukkusati,<BR>
Bhaddiya, Kha&otilde;.dadeva, Bahuraggi and Pingiya.<BR>
They gave up human bodies and obtained heavenly ones.</P>
<P>4. To tell their merit, how they overcame the snare of death,<BR>
Knowing whose Teaching did they cut the bond `to be'.</P>
<P>5. It's not in another's but the Blessed One's dispensation,<BR>
They learnt the Teaching and cut the bond `to be'.<BR>
They destroyed name and matter without a hold.<BR>
Knowing this Teaching they cut the bond `to be'&ucirc;</P>
<P>6. &szlig;You say wise words, difficult to understand and realize.<BR>
Knowing whose Teaching do you speak words like these?&ucirc;</P>
<P>7. &szlig;In the past, there was a potter named Gathikara in Vehalinga.<BR>
He, a lay disciple of the Blessed One Kassapa, cared for his mother and father.<BR>
Refraining from sexuality, he led a holy life and abstained from eating meat.<BR>
They came from the same village, they were your friends.<BR>
I know this, with the destruction of greed and anger,</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>The seven bhikkhus are released from the diffused ness of the world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>8. &szlig;As Bhaggava says there was, in the past a lay disciple of the Blessed One Kassapa, who cared for his mother and father.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He refrained from sexuality, led a holy life and abstained from eating meat.<BR>
We came from the same village, we were friends.<BR>
Thus the friends of yore have met,<BR>
We two having developed our selves, bear the last bodies.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. 3. 5.</P>
<P>(25) Jantu &Yacute; Jantu the Son of the Gods</P>
<P>I heard thus. At that time many bhikkhus were living in forest huts on the side of the Himalayas in the country of Kosala. They were sportive, arrogant, with loose talk, with roaming and uncontrolled minds.</P>
<P>2. On the fifteenth day of the full moon, Jantu, the son of the gods approached those bhikkhus and said this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;In the past, there were disciple bhikkhus, of Gotama,<BR>
They did not long for scraps of food, beds and seats.<BR>
Knowing the impermanent nature of the world, they ended unpleasantness.<BR>
You, have not developed the self, like the village headman.<BR>
You eat and sleep as though swooned in another one's house.<BR>
I worship the community of bhikkhus,<BR>
If you are impure, there is no refuge and are like those dead and gone.<BR>
These words I said are to the negligent.<BR>
Here I worship the diligent.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. 3. 6.</P>
<P>(26) Rohita &Yacute; Rohita the Son of the Gods</P>
<P>1. The Blessed One was living in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. Rohita, the son of the gods standing on a side said this in the presence of the Blessed One.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, is it possible to know, see, and attain that state where there isn't birth, decay, death, decrease and rebirth by traveling, to the end of the world?&ucirc;</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Friend, I say, it is not possible to know, see, and attain that state where there isn't birth, decay, death, decrease and rebirth by traveling, to the end of the world.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Venerable sir, these are good words of the Blessed One. `Friend, I say it is not possible to know, see, and attain that state where there isn't birth, decay, death, decrease and rebirth by traveling, to the end of the world'</P>
<P>5. Venerable sir, in the past there was a sage named Rohita, the son of Bhoja. He was very powerful and travelled, through the air.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, it was me and I had a speed similar to the speed of a well trained archer who could split a palm, shooting with his bow and bring it down in no time.</P>
<P>6. If I put one foot in the eastern ocean, the other was in the western, such was my span. And I had a wish like this, by walking I shall arrive at the end of the world.</P>
<P>7. Venerable sir, endowed with that speed and span of walking, I, a being with a life span of a hundred years and living a hundred years, did not stop other than for eating drinking, enjoying food, for urinating and excreting, other than to dispel sleepiness and tiredness. Yet I died before reaching the end of the world, at the end of the hundred years.</P>
<P>8. Venerable sir, these words of the Blessed One are wonderful and surprising. `Friend, I say, it is not possible to know, see, and attain that state where there isn't birth, decay, death, decrease and rebirth by traveling, to the end of the world'</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Yet, friend, without reaching the end of the world, I say, there is no ending of un &Yacute; pleasantness. Yet friend, in this fathom long body, this perceptive form, I appoint the world, its arising, its ceasing and the path leading to its cessation.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>10. &szlig;The end of the world cannot be reached by traveling.<BR>
Yet, without coming to the end of the world, <BR>
there's no release from unpleasantness.<BR>
Therefore be wise, know the nature of the world.<BR>
Lead the holy life to the end of the world.<BR>
The appeased, know the end of the world.<BR>
And do not wish for, this or the other world.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. 3. 7.</P>
<P>(27) Nando &Yacute; Nanda the Son of the Gods</P>
<P>Nanda the son of the gods standing on a side said this stanza to the Blessed One.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Time passes, the nights go by,<BR>
The life span of humans, gradually dwindle.<BR>
Seeing this fear, of death<BR>
Do merit, that brings pleasant results<BR>
Time passes, the nights go by,<BR>
The life span of humans, dwindle.<BR>
Seeing this fear, of death<BR>
Give up the material world, for appeasement.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. 3. 8.</P>
<P>(28) Nandivisalo &Yacute; Nandivisala the son of the gods.</P>
<P>Nandivisala, the son of the gods, standing on a side said this stanza to the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Born from dust we are four wheels, nine entrances<BR>
And merit mixed with greed.<BR>
Hero, how should we proceed?&ucirc;<BR>
&szlig;Cut, interest, the straps, desires, greed and demerit,<BR>
Also uproot craving completely and then proceed.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. 3. 9.</P>
<P>(29) Susimo &Yacute; Susima the Son of the Gods</P>
<P>1. At S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. Venerable &acirc;nanda approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on side. Then the Blessed One said thus to venerable &acirc;nanda:</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, is S&agrave;riputta pleased with you too?&ucirc;</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Venerable sir, how could venerable S&agrave;riputta be displeased with someone, who is not a fool, not corrupt, not erring and thinks in a constructive way? Venerable sir, venerable S&agrave;riputta is very wise, has a wide understanding, is quick witted, has keen intelligence, has sharp and penetrating wisdom, has few desires, is satisfied, is secluded and without associations, with aroused effort, particular about his observances, speaks gently, exhorts reprovingly, disapproves evil, so why should venerable S&agrave;riputta be displeased with someone, who is not a fool, not corrupt, not erring and thinks in a constructive way.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;&acirc;nanda, you are right, how could S&agrave;riputta be displeased with someone, who is not a fool, not corrupt, not erring and thinks in a constructive way? &acirc;nanda, S&agrave;riputta, is very wise, has a wide understanding, is quick witted, has keen intelligence, has sharp and penetrating wisdom, has few desires, is satisfied, is secluded and without associations, with aroused effort, particular about his observances, speaks gently, exhorts reprovingly, disapproves evil, so why should S&agrave;riputta be displeased with someone, who is not a fool, not corrupt, not erring and thinks in a constructive way?&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. Then Susima the son of the gods hearing the words, praising venerable S&agrave;riputta accompanied by a large number of sons of gods, approached the Blessed One, worshipped and stood on a side.</P>
<P>6. Standing on a side, Susima the son of the gods said thus to the Blessed One:</P>
<P>&szlig;That is so, Blessed One! It's so, Well Gone One! How could venerable S&agrave;riputta be displeased with someone, who is not a fool, not corrupt, not erring and thinks in a constructive way? Venerable sir, venerable S&agrave;riputta is very wise, has a wide understanding, is quick witted, has keen intelligence, has sharp and penetrating wisdom, has few desires, is satisfied, is secluded and without associations, with aroused effort, is particular about his observances, speaks gently, exhorts reprovingly, disapproves evil, so why should venerable S&agrave;riputta be displeased with someone, who is not a fool, not corrupt, not erring and thinks in a constructive way?&ucirc;</P>
<P>7. Then Susima, the son of the god's companions, the sons of gods, hearing the words of praise given to venerable S&agrave;riputta were delighted and overjoyed and spoke high and low about venerable S&agrave;riputta making their own manifestations of him.</P>
<P>8. Like the beryl gem with a good birth, cut on the eight sides, placed on an orange blanket would shine and give luster, in the same manner Susima, the son of the god's companions, the sons of gods hearing the words of praise given to venerable S&agrave;riputta were delighted and overjoyed and spoke high and low about venerable S&agrave;riputta making their own manifestations of him.</P>
<P>9. Like a golden ornament completed by a well accomplished expert goldsmith, placed on an orange blanket would shine and give luster, in the same manner Susima, the son of the god's companion gods, the sons of gods, hearing the words of praise given to venerable S&agrave;riputta were delighted and overjoyed and spoke high and low about venerable S&agrave;riputta making their own manifestations of him.</P>
<P>10. Like the morning star which shines resplendent in the sky in the last watch of the night, in the same manner Susima, the son of the god's companions, the sons of gods, hearing the words of praise given to venerable S&agrave;riputta were delighted and overjoyed and spoke high and low about venerable S&agrave;riputta making their own manifestations of him.</P>
<P>11. Like the sun in the Autumn, risen in a cloudless sky and dispelling all darkness would shine and burn, in the same manner Susima, the son of the god's companions the sons of gods, hearing the words of praise given to venerable S&agrave;riputta were delighted and overjoyed and spoke high and low about venerable S&agrave;riputta making their own manifestations of him.</P>
<P>12. Then Susima the son of the gods said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One, about venerable S&agrave;riputta:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;S&agrave;riputta, considered as wise, is without anger,<BR>
With few desires, is gentle and tame, he is the sage praised by the Teacher.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>13. The Blessed One in reply to Susima the son of the gods said this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;S&agrave;riputta, considered as wise, is without anger,<BR>
With few desires, is gentle and tame, he marks time attending carefully.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>2. 3. 10.</P>
<P>(30) Nanatitthiya &Yacute; Gods with Various Beliefs</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha.</P>
<P>2. Then a large number of sons of gods, disciples of adherents of other sects such as Asama, Sahali, Nimko, &acirc;ko&ntilde;ako, Ve&ntilde;ambari and Manava-Gamiyo, when the night was waning, illuminating the whole of the bamboo grove with an effulgent light approached the Blessed One, worshipped and stood on a side.</P>
<P>3. Asama the son of the gods standing on a side said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One alluding to Purana Kassapa:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Here, death was cut,<BR>
Kassapa knew the destruction,<BR>
Evil will not rise again,<BR>
Not even merit for the self<BR>
If it was told with confidence,<BR>
The teacher should be respected as perfect.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>4. Sahali the son of the gods standing on a side said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One alluding to Makkhali Gos&agrave;la:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;To train the self, doing austerities to bear hunger,<BR>
Giving up words that arouse quarrels,<BR>
Ignoring faults and avoiding the truth,<BR>
Are they not evil actions?&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>5. Nimko the son of the gods standing on a side said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One alluding to Nigantha Nataputta:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;The bhikkhu clever at avoiding,<BR>
Observes the fourfold restraints,<BR>
Tells what he saw and heard,<BR>
Isn't it doing demerit?&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>6. &acirc;ko&ntilde;aka the son of the gods standing on a side said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One alluding to the sects with various beliefs:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Pakudha Katiyana, Nigantha,<BR>
This, Makkhali and Purana,<BR>
Known as the teachers of gatherings,<BR>
Aren't they far away from Great Beings?&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>7. Then Vetambari the son of the gods as a reply to &acirc;kotaka the son of the gods said this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Given all respects, he is a corpse, a jackal,<BR>
A sham ascetic could never be a lion.<BR>
The teacher of the gathering goes naked, tells lies<BR>
Suspects everything, does not seem to have mindfulness.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>8. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one seized the consciousness of Vetambari, the son of the gods and said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Conquering hunger, with austerities<BR>
And succeeding in seclusions<BR>
Those fixed to matter enjoy heavenly bliss,<BR>
They give the correct advice for the next world.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>9. The Blessed One knowing, that it was M&agrave;ra the evil one, said this stanza to M&agrave;ra the evil one</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Whatever matter, in this or the other world,<BR>
Even a resplendent light in the sky,<BR>
All that is praised by Namuci<BR>
That's material thrown for the ill being,<BR>
Of human beings.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>10. Manava Gamini the son of the gods standing on a side said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One alluding to the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;For the people of Rajagaha, there is a huge prominent rock<BR>
For the Himalayas, the foremost is Seta,<BR>
For going in space, the foremost is the Sun<BR>
Of waters the foremost is the ocean,<BR>
Of constellations the moon,<BR>
To the world with its gods, the enlightened one is the foremost.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
