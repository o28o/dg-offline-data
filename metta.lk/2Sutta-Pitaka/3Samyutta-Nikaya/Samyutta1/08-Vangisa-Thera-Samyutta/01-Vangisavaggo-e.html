<P>8. 1. 1.</P>
<P>(1) Nikkhantam &Yacute; Renouncing</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa lived in Alavi in the Aggalavi monument with his teacher Nigrodha Kappa.</P>
<P>2. At the time venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa was a novice, one who had gone forth recently. He was living under the orders of the chief resident monk.</P>
<P>3. Then many women who were anxious to wander about in the monastery, decorating themselves approached the monastery.</P>
<P>4. Seeing those women, venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa was discontented, lust arising in his mind.</P>
<P>5. Then it occurred to venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa: `This is not gain for me. This should not happen to me, this discontent with lust arising in my mind. How could I dispel the discontent of others and arouse contentment in their hearts. What if I dispel my discontent and arouse contentment in my heart?&ucirc;</P>
<P>6. Then venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa dispelled his discontent and aroused contentment in his heart and uttered these stanzas that moment.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;I renounced my household and became homeless in want of appeasement,<BR>
Yet these dark unruly thoughts disturb me. I'm one, thoroughly trained,<BR>
Uggaputta of Mahisa is my teacher. Let any amount of women come and surround.<BR>
I will not go away from the Community, they will not change me.<BR>
I am well established in the Teaching.&ucirc;<BR>
I thoroughly know the words of the relation of the Sun.<BR>
My mind is well established in the path of extinction.<BR>
Even when living thus, the Evil One pounces on me.<BR>
I will not let Death know my path.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>8. 1. 2.</P>
<P>(2) Arati &Yacute; Discontent</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa lived in Alavi in the Aggalavi monument with his teacher Nigrodha Kappa.</P>
<P>2. At the time venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa was a novice, one who had gone forth recently. He was living under the orders of the chief resident monk.</P>
<P>3. During that time venerable Nigrodha Kappa returned to the monastery after the alms round and after the meal. Even in the evening he leaves the monastery or the next day.</P>
<P>4. At such times, venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa was discontented, with lust arising in his mind.</P>
<P>5. Then it occurred to venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa: &szlig;This is not gain for me. This should not happen to me, this discontent, with lust arising in my mind. How could I dispel the discontent of others and arouse contentment in their hearts. What if I dispel my discontentment and arouse contentment in my heart?&ucirc;</P>
<P>6. Then venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa dispelled his discontentment and aroused contentment in his heart and uttered these stanzas that moment.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Dispelling discontentment, attachment and all worldly thoughts<BR>
Not craving for anything in the world,<BR>
Endures freedom, from lust and attachment,<BR>
All material in the whole world, on earth or in the sky<BR>
Are impermanent, decay, knowing this,<BR>
I behave with the self released.<BR>
People are enslaved to endearments seeing, hearing, or sensing angrily.<BR>
Dispel that interest unmoved. If you are not soiled there,you are a sage.<BR>
On account of sixty wrongly clung thoughts<BR>
The ordinary man does unrighteous things.<BR>
The bhikkhu does not take sides, nor make lewd speech.<BR>
With a cause, he is concentrated throughout a long time.<BR>
Not deceitful, he is clever and not greedy,<BR>
He has attained appeasement on account of the sage.<BR>
And extinguished, he marks time.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>8. 1. 3.</P>
<P>(3) Pesala Atima¤¤ana &Yacute; Belittling the Well-behaved Bhikkhus</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa lived in Alavi in the Aggalavi monument with his teacher Nigrodha Kappa.</P>
<P>2. At the time venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa proud of his understanding belittled well-behaved bhikkhus.</P>
<P>3. Then it occurred to venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa: `This is not gain for me. This should not happen to me. I am proud of my understanding and belittle well-behaved bhikkhus.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. Then venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa counseled himself arousing remorse for his pride and that moment said these stanzas.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Disciples of Gotama, dispel conceit and the sources from which it rise<BR>
Until all sources of conceit are dispelled be remorseful for it<BR>
Through the mouth you become merciless. The conceited fall in hell<BR>
The conceited born in hell suffer long. The bhikkhu who has won the path,<BR>
And rightfully fallen to that path never grieve any more.<BR>
They enjoy fame and pleasantness. To this is called, attachment to the Teaching.<BR>
Therefore make endeavor, pull the arrow and dispelling obstacles be pure.<BR>
And understand, make an end of unpleasantness and be calmed.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>1. At one time venerable &acirc;nanda was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. Then venerable &acirc;nanda putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered S&agrave;vatthi for alms with venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa as the second recluse.</P>
<P>3. At that time, venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa was discontented, with lust arising in his mind.</P>
<P>4. Then venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa said this stanza to venerable &acirc;nanda:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;My mind is burning with sensual greed, <BR>
I am a disciple of Gotama; Please tell me, how should I purify my mind?&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(&acirc;nanda:)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>5. &szlig;Your mind is burning because of a distorted perception<BR>
Avoid that passionate sign, you have welcomed<BR>
Reflect determinations as foreign, unpleasant and lacking a self.<BR>
Extinguish greed altogether and do not be burnt again and again.<BR>
Develop loathsomeness and concentrate the mind in one point.<BR>
Develop mindfulness of the body for welfare and turn away with disgust<BR>
Develop the mind without a sign and expel the tendency to measure.<BR>
Thus overcoming measuring live appeased.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>3. And those bhikkhus said: &szlig;Yes, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. The Blessed One said: &szlig;Bhikkhus, words, endowed with four factors become good, not wrongly uttered, faultless and not blamed by the wise. What four?</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu says only good words, talks only the Teaching nothing outside. Utters pleasant words not the unpleasant and tells the truth not a lie. Bhikkhus, endowed with these four factors words, become good, not wrongly uttered, faultless and not blamed by the wise.&ucirc;</P>
<P>6. The Well Gone One; the Teacher further said thus:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;The appeased said that good words are noble<BR>
Utter, words about the Teaching, not outside, that's the second<BR>
Third is, utter pleasant words not the unpleasant.<BR>
And tell the truth not lies, that is the fourth.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>7. Then venerable Va&iuml;g&atilde;sa got up from his seat, arranged his robe and clasping hands towards the Blessed One said: &szlig;Venerable sir, Blessed One, it occurs to me.&ucirc;</P>

<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Say only those words, that do not arouse remorse in you,<BR>
And do not hurt others. They are good words.<BR>
Say pleasant words and rejoice later.<BR>
Talk pleasant words to others, without hurting them.<BR>
The truth does not die. This is the ancient lore.<BR>
The appeased are established in the truth, useful and the righteous<BR>
And the appeased words of the Enlightened One,<BR>
To end unpleasantness are the most noble of words.&ucirc;</P>
