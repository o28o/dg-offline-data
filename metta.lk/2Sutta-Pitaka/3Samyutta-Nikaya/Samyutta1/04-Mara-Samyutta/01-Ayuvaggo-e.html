<P>4. 1. 1.</P>
<P>(1) Tapo Kamma¤ca</P>
<P>1. Thus I heard. Soon after enlightenment, the Blessed One was living in S&agrave;vatthi on the bank of river Nera¤jara, at the root of the Ajap&agrave;la banyan tree.</P>
<P>2. When the Blessed One was in seclusion this thought and thought process arose to him: `I am released from that difficult task. Good that I am released from that useless, difficult task. Good, I was mindful and attained enlightenment!'</P>
<P>3. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one knowing the thought and thought process that had arisen to the Blessed One, approached and said a stanza to the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Without developing the austerities, how is the human to be purified?<BR>
An impure one thinks he is pure, you have missed the path of purity.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>4. The Blessed One, recognizing the evil one, replied him with a stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;I know the uselessness of all other austerities,<BR>
All that miscarries one, like dear ones, removed from righteousness,<BR>
I know the path and develop virtues, concentration and wisdom.<BR>
I have attained the highest purity. Go away! You are the ender.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>5. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one knew, &szlig;The Blessed One has recognized me,&ucirc; became displeased and vanished from there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4. 1. 2.</P>
<P>(2) N&agrave;go &Yacute; A Huge Elephant</P>
<P>1. Thus I heard. Before enlightenment, the Blessed One was living in S&agrave;vatthi on the bank of river Nera¤jara, at the root of the Ajap&agrave;la banyan tree. At that time the Blessed One was seated in open space, in the dark and drops of rain were also falling.</P>
<P>2. M&agrave;ra the evil one, intending to frighten the Blessed One, creating the form of a huge elephant approached the Blessed One.</P>
<P>3. His head was a huge bubble of glittering glass, teeth like silver coins. The trunk was like the huge beam of a plough.</P>
<P>4. The Blessed One knowing that it's M&agrave;ra the evil one, said this stanza to him.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Creating forms good and evil, you fare in existences long,<BR>
Enough of it, evil one, you are the ender.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>5. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one knew, &szlig;The Blessed One has recognized me,&ucirc; became displeased and vanished from there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4. 1. 3.</P>
<P>(3) Subha&uuml; &Yacute; Welcome Forms</P>
<P>1. At Uruwela.</P>
<P>2. At that time the Blessed One was seated in open space, in the dark and drops of rain were also falling.</P>
<P>3. M&agrave;ra the evil one intended to frighten the Blessed One.</P>
<P>4. M&agrave;ra approached the Blessed One and created large and small forms welcome and unwelcome not far away from the Blessed One.</P>
<P>5. The Blessed One knowing that it's M&agrave;ra the evil one, said this stanza to him.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Creating forms good and evil, you fare in existences long,<BR>
Enough of it, evil one, you are the ender.<BR>
M&agrave;ra those restrained in body, words and mind,<BR>
Are not in your power and do not follow you.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>6. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one knew, &szlig;The Blessed One has recognized me,&ucirc; became displeased and vanished from there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4. 1. 4.</P>
<P>(4) P&agrave;sa I &Yacute; The Snare I</P>
<P>1. At one time, the Blessed One was living in the deer park, in Isispatana in Benares.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there thus: &szlig;Bhikkhus, wisely thinking I made the right endeavor and attained and realized noble release Bhikkhus, you too think wisely, make the right endeavor and attain and realize noble release.&ucirc;</P>
<P>3. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one approached the Blessed One and said this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Whether heavenly or human you are bound by the snares of Death,<BR>
Recluse, you are bound by death, not released by me.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(Bhagava:)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>4. &szlig;Whatever it may be, heavenly or human, am not bound by the snares of death.<BR>
Am released from the bonds of death, go away! You are the ender.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>5. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one knew, &szlig;The Blessed One has recognized me,&ucirc; became displeased and vanished from there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4. 1. 5.</P>
<P>(5) P&agrave;sa II &Yacute; The Snare II</P>
<P>1. At one time, the Blessed One was living in the deer park, in Isispatana in Benares.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there thus: &szlig;Bhikkhus, I am released from all snares whether heavenly or human. Bhikkhus, you too work out your release from all snares whether heavenly or human. For the welfare and good of many, gods and men, go on tours. Two should not go on the same path. Bhikkhus, preach the Teaching. Good in the beginning middle and end, meaningful even in the letters proclaiming the pure, holy life completely. There will be beings with a few defiling things, they will deteriorate owing to not hearing the Teaching. There will be those who realize the Teaching. I too will proceed to the hamlet Senani to preach.&ucirc;</P>
<P>3. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one approached the Blessed One and said this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Whether heavenly or human you are bound by all snares.<BR>
Recluse, you are bound by a huge bond. I will not release you.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(Bhagava:)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>4. &szlig;Whatever it may be, heavenly or human, am released from all snares.<BR>
I am released from the great bond. Go away! You are the ender.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>4. 1. 6.</P>
<P>(6) Sappo &Yacute; A Serpent</P>
<P>1. Thus I heard. At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha.</P>
<P>2. At that time the Blessed One was seated in open space, in the dark and drops of rain were also falling.</P>
<P>3. M&agrave;ra the evil one intending to frighten the Blessed One, creating the form of a huge serpent, approached the Blessed One.</P>
<P>4. Its body was like a boat, head like a brewer's strainer, eyes, like bronze bowls of Kosala measure. Its hanging tongue was like lightening from a rainy cloud. His breathing gave the sound of the bellows of a smithy.</P>
<P>5. The Blessed One knowing that it's M&agrave;ra the evil one, said these stanzas to him:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;To him who abounds empty houses, the sage, skilled in the self is excellent,<BR>
Give up and go to him, you are an imitation of such ones<BR>
There, you get many, animals, fears, flies that sting and many creeping things<BR>
Even a hair does not stand, of the great sage entering an empty house<BR>
The sky may split, the earth may shiver, all, living things may be frightened<BR>
Even the arrow in the heart would quake and enlightened ones do not make bonds.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>6. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one knew, &szlig;The Blessed One has recognized me,&ucirc; became displeased and vanished from there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4. 1. 7.</P>
<P>(7) Suppati &Yacute; Sleeping</P>
<P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One spent most of the night mindfully walking and in the last watch of the night, washing his feet, entered the monastery. Turning on his right he lay down keeping one foot over the other making the lion's posture and mindful of the perception of waking.</P>
<P>3. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one approached the Blessed One said this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Why do you sleep? What do you dream?<BR>
Why do you sleep here, as though injured?<BR>
When the sun is rising why do you sleep?&ucirc;<BR>
Do you think it is an empty house?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;I am not carried anywhere, by deceptive craving, the sinful bend,<BR>
I sleep having realized and destroyed all clingings to rebirth.<BR>
What does it matter to you, M&agrave;ra?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>4. 1. 8.</P>
<P>(8) Nandana&uuml; &Yacute; Rejoicing</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one approached the Blessed One and said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Those who have sons, rejoice in sons.<BR>
Those who have cattle, rejoice in the herd.<BR>
Humans rejoice in clinging,<BR>
Without a clinging, there is no rejoicing.&ucirc;</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Those who have sons, grieve because of sons.<BR>
Those who have cattle grieve because of the herd.<BR>
Clinging, is the sorrow of humans.<BR>
When there is no clinging, there is no grief.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>4. 1. 9.</P>
<P>(9) &acirc;yu I &Yacute; The Lifespan I</P>
<P>1. Thus I heard. At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there:</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Bhikkhus, the lifespan of human's is a short one. It's a marching to the next world. Merit should be done and the holy life should be lead. To the born, there is no alternative but death. Bhikkhus, if anyone lives long, it's nothing more than a hundred years.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one approached the Blessed One and said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;The lifespan of humans is long, it should not be disdained by man.<BR>
Enjoy life be happy, there is no returning after death.</P>
<P>5. The lifespan of humans is short, it should be disdained by man.<BR>
Live like one with the head burning, there is not a non-returning after death.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>6. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one knew, &szlig;The Blessed One has recognized me,&ucirc; became displeased and vanished from there.</P>

<P>The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there:</P>
<P>&szlig;Bhikkhus, the lifespan of human's is a short one. It's a marching, to the next world. Merit should be done and the holy life should be lead. To the born, there is no alternative but death. Bhikkhus, if anyone lives long, it's nothing more than a hundred years.&ucirc;</P>
<P>2. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one approached the Blessed One and said this stanza in the presence of the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Day and night do not vanish, life does not get destroyed.<BR>
The lifespan of humans turn, like the knob of the chariot wheel.&ucirc;</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Day and night vanish, life gets destroyed.<BR>
The lifespan of humans diminish, like water in rivulets</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>4. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one knew, &szlig;The Blessed One has recognized me,' became displeased and vanished from there.</P>
