<P>4. 3. 1.</P>
<P>Sambahul&agrave; &Yacute; (21) Many Bhikkhus</P>
<P>1. Thus I heard. At one time the Blessed One was living on a rock, in the country of the Sakyas.</P>
<P>2. At the time, many bhikkhus were living diligently in the vicinity of the Blessed One, with aroused effort for dispelling.</P>
<P>3. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one creating the form of an aged Brahmin bent like the beam of a roof, with a large topknot, dressed in a cloth made of strips of antelope hide, breathing heavily and with a stick in his hand approached those bhikkhus and said: &szlig;Venerable ones are young, gone forth in the prime of youth, have not enjoyed sensual pleasures. Good ones, partake sensual pleasures, do not abandon what is here and now and search in time.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Brahmin, we have not given up the here and now and do not run with time. We have given up the short lived, and search the here and now. Brahmin, the Blessed One has said that sensual pleasures are short lived with much unpleasantness and worries. Sensual pleasures have many dangers. This Teaching is here and now time does not matter to it, is inviting to come and see and leads inwards. It's to be realized by the wise.</P>
<P>5. When this was said, M&agrave;ra the evil one shook his head, pulled out his tongue, curved his forehead, to form three lines and went away leaning on his stick.</P>
<P>6. Then those bhikkhus approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said thus:</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Venerable sir, we were living diligently in the vicinity of the Blessed One, with aroused effort for dispelling.</P>
<P>Then an aged Brahmin bent like the beam of a roof, with a large topknot, dressed in a cloth made of strips of antelope hide, breathing heavily and with a stick in his hand approached us and said Venerable ones are young, gone forth in the prime of youth, have not enjoyed sensual pleasures. Good ones, partake, sensual pleasures, do not abandon what is here and now and search in time</P>
<P>8. Then venerable sir, we said thus to that Brahmin, we have not given up the here and now and do not run with time. We have given up the short lived, and search the here and now. Brahmin, the Blessed One has said that sensual pleasures are short lived with much unpleasantness and worries. Sensual pleasures have many dangers. This Teaching is here and now time does not matter to it, is inviting to come and see and leads inwards. It's to be realized by the wise.</P>
<P>9. When we said the he shook his head, pulled out his tongue, curved his forehead, to form three lines and went away leaning on his stick.</P>
<P>10. Bhikkhus, that is not a Brahmin, he is M&agrave;ra the evil one, he had come to distract you.</P>
<P>11. Then the Blessed One knowing its meaning said this st&agrave;nza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;If someone sees unpleasantness and its origin,<BR>
He would not turn to sensuality again.<BR>
Knowing endearments, as the bond in the world<BR>
That man will train, to discipline it.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>4. 3. 2.</P>
<P>(22) Samiddhi &Yacute; Venerable Samiddhi</P>
<P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living on a rock, in the country of the Sakyas.</P>
<P>2. At the time, venerable Samiddhi was living diligently in the vicinity of the Blessed One, with aroused effort for dispelling.</P>
<P>3. When venerable Samiddhi was in his seclusion, this thought and thought process arose to him. It is great gain, my Teacher is perfect and rightfully enlightened. It is great gain to me that I have gone forth in a dispensation so well declared. It is great gain to me that my co-associates are virtuous and good friends.</P>
<P>4. M&agrave;ra the evil one knowing venerable Samiddhi's thought process, approached venerable Samiddhi and made a fearful sound close to him, so to think that the earth was falling to pieces.</P>
<P>5. Then venerable Samiddhi approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said:</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Venerable sir, I was living diligently in the vicinity of the Blessed One, with aroused effort for dispelling and when I was in seclusion, this thought and thought process arose to me. It is great gain my Teacher is perfect and rightfully enlightened. It is great gain to me that I have gone forth in a dispensation so well declared. It is great gain to me, that my co-associates are virtuous and good friends. Then venerable sir, I heard a fearful sound, close to me, as though, the earth was falling to pieces.&ucirc;</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Samiddhi, it is not the earth falling to pieces, it's M&agrave;ra the evil one come to distract you. Samiddhi, go, there itself and live diligent to dispel.&ucirc;</P>
<P>8. Venerable Samiddhi agreeing, got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One and went.</P>
<P>9. A second time, venerable Samiddhi was living diligently there itself with aroused effort for dispelling, and the second time, when venerable Samiddhi was in his seclusion, this thought and thought process arose to him. It is great gain my Teacher is perfect and rightfully enlightened. It is great gain that I have gone forth in a dispensation so well declared. It is great gain to me that my co-associates are virtuous and good friends. M&agrave;ra the evil one knowing venerable Samkiddhi's thought process, approached venerable Samiddhi, for the second time and made a fearful sound close to him, so to think that the earth was falling to pieces.</P>
<P>10. Venerable Samiddhi knowing, it's M&agrave;ra the evil one said this stanza to him:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;I left the household and went forth, out of faith.<BR>
I have attained mindfulness and wisdom<BR>
My mind is concentrated. Do what you like to this body<BR>
Do not trouble me.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>11. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one knowing, venerable Samiddhi knows me disappeared from there, displeased.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4. 3. 3.</P>
<P>(23) Godhika &Yacute; Venerable Godhika</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time, the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary, in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha.</P>
<P>2. At that time venerable Godhika was living on the Black Rock on the side of Isigili.</P>
<P>3. Venerable Godhika while abiding diligent to dispel touched the release of mind in concentration. Then venerable Godhika fell away from that release of mind in concentration.</P>
<P>4. For the second time venerable Godhika while abiding diligent to dispel touched the release of mind in concentration. For the second time venerable Godhika fell away from that release of mind in concentration.</P>
<P>5. For the third time venerable Godhika while abiding diligent to dispel touched the release of mind in concentration. For the third time venerable Godhika fell away from that release of mind in concentration.</P>
<P>6. For the fourth time venerable Godhika while abiding diligent to dispel touched the release of mind in concentration. For the fourth time venerable Godhika fell away from that release of mind in concentration.</P>
<P>7. For the fifth time, venerable Godhika while abiding diligent to dispel touched the release of mind in concentration. For the fifth time venerable Godhika fell away from that release of mind in concentration.</P>
<P>8. For the sixth time venerable Godhika while abiding diligent to dispel touched the release of mind in concentration. For the sixth time venerable Godhika fell away from that release of mind in concentration.</P>
<P>9. For the seventh time venerable Godhika while abiding diligent to dispel touched the release of mind in concentration. For the seventh time.</P>
<P>10. Then it occurred to venerable Godhika, up to the sixth time I fell away from that release of mind in concentration. What if I take my life?</P>
<P>11. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one knowing the thought process in the mind of venerable Godhika approached the Blessed One and said this stanza to the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Great hero, wise man, burning with power and fame,<BR>
You dispel the anger and fear of all, I worship your feet and tell you.<BR>
A disciple of yours intends to kill himself. Splendid one, restrain him, from that.<BR>
Blessed One, how do your disciples live attached to the dispensation?<BR>
Have people heard of a trainer killing himself, without becoming a perfect one.</P>
<P>12. By that time venerable Godhika had destroyed himself.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>13. The Blessed One, knowing it was M&agrave;ra the evil, one said this stanza to him:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;The wise do this sort of thing, do not fall back to live,<BR>
Godhika has uprooted all craving, he is extinguished.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>14. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: &szlig;Bhikkhus, let us approach the Black Rock on the side of Isigili, there Godhika, the son of the clansman has taken his life.&ucirc;</P>
<P>15. Those bhikkhus agreed.</P>
<P>16. The Blessed One, with many bhikkhus, approached the Black Rock on the side of Isigili. The Blessed One saw even in the distance, the body of venerable Godhika lying lifeless on the bed.</P>
<P>17. At that time a dark mist moved, to the east, then to the west, then to the north and the south, above and below and to the inter directions.</P>
<P>18. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: &szlig;Bhikkhus, do you see that dark mist, moving to the east, then to the west, then to the north and the south, above and below and to the inter directions?&ucirc; &szlig;Yes. Venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>19. &szlig;Bhikkhus, that's M&agrave;ra the evil one searching after the consciousness of the clansman Godhika, as to where, it is settled.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;The clanman's son Godhika's consciousness is not settled anywhere, he has extinguished.&ucirc;</P>
<P>20. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one approached the Blessed One with his yellow flute and said this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;I searched above, below, in the middle, the four directions and inter-directions<BR>
Yet, I did not find Godhaka. Where has he gone?&ucirc;</P>
<P>21. &szlig;That wise courageous concentrator was always attached to it,<BR>
He was yoked to it, day and night did not wish to live.<BR>
Has destroyed the array of death, without coming, `to be' again.<BR>
Destroying craving completely Godhaka has extinguished.&ucirc;</P>
<P>22. Then the violin under the arm of the grieving one vanished<BR>
And the displeased non-human vanished from there.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>4. 3. 4.</P>
<P>(24) Sattavass&agrave;ni &Yacute; For Seven Years</P>
<P>1. Thus I heard. At that time, the Blessed One was living in Uruwela on the bank of river Nera¤jara at the root of the banyan tree.</P>
<P>2. For seven years, M&agrave;ra the Evil One had been pursuing the Blessed One, desiring a chance to snatch a flaw in his mindfulness and had been unsuccessful.</P>
<P>3. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one approached the Blessed One and said a stanza.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Is it overcome with grief that you concentrate in forests?<BR>
Or is it the decrease of wealth and wishing for it?<BR>
Or have you done any offence in the village?<BR>
Why don't people see what you're doing?<BR>
I stand eye-witness you have no prosperity what so ever.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. I have dug up, all roots of grief,<BR>
And I do not burn, because of an offence.<BR>
I have destroyed all greedy thoughts `to be.&ucirc;<BR>
Relation of negligence I concentrate without desires.</P>
<P>5. &szlig;When words say, this is mine, or if they say it's me,<BR>
There, the mind is established. Recluse, you are not released.&ucirc;</P>
<P>6.&ucirc;If words say, it is not mine, or if they say it is not me,<BR>
Evil One, know this! You will not see my path.</P>
<P>7. &szlig;If you have realized the path of appeasement to deathlessness,<BR>
Leave and go alone! Why do you advise others?&ucirc;</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Humans who want to cross over, ask about the Deathless domain<BR>
When asked I tell them, where everything is without trouble.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>9. &szlig;Venerable sir, not far away from the village or hamlet there is a pond, and in it there is a crab. Many boys and girls from the village or hamlet come to the pond and taking the crab from the pond put it on dry land. Whenever the crab puts forth a claw, those boys and girls break them and destroy them with stones or sticks. The crab with all its claws destroyed cannot go back to the pond, in which it lived. In the same manner venerable sir, the Blessed One has broken and destroyed whatever distortions, tricks and writhings I valued, now I have no excuse to approach the Blessed One.</P>
<P>10. Then M&agrave;ra the evil one said these stanzas of his rejection, in the presence of the Blessed one:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;A bird followed and went round, a golden colored mountain.<BR>
We were not treated kindly had no satisfaction,<BR>
Not getting the satisfaction, we go away.<BR>
Like a crow that injured a rock, we give up Gotama.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>11. M&agrave;ra the evil one, saying these stanzas in the presence of the Blessed One left the Blessed One and not far away from the Blessed One sat on the ground, legs crossed. He was silent, confused, crest fallen and face turned downwards, unable to reply. He was digging the ground with stick.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>4. 3. 5.</P>
<P>(25) Dh&atilde;taro &Yacute; Daughters of M&agrave;ra</P>
<P>1. At Uruvela.</P>
<P>Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion, the three daughters of M&agrave;ra, approached him and said this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Dear father, why do you sit displeased, <BR>
because of which man do you grieve?<BR>
With the snare of passion, will bind and bring him to you, <BR>
like an elephant in the forest.&ucirc;</P>
<P>2. &szlig;It's not easy to bring the Perfect, Well Gone One, with passion<BR>
He has gone beyond the domains of Death, therefore I grieve much.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>3. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion, the three daughters of M&agrave;ra, approached the Blessed One and said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Recluse, we will attend to you, at your feet.&ucirc; The Blessed One did not care for those words and sat as though released with the destruction of endearments.</P>
<P>4. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra went to a side and discussed, the intentions of man rise and fall, what if each one of us, create the forms of one hundred young women.</P>
<P>5. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra, each one of them, created the forms of one hundred young women, approached the Blessed One and said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Recluse, we will attend to you, at your feet.&ucirc; The Blessed One did not care for those words, he sat as though released with the destruction of endearments.</P>
<P>6. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra went to a side and discussed, the intentions of man rise and fall, what if each one of us, create the forms of one hundred young women who have not given birth.</P>
<P>7. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra, each one of them, created the forms of one hundred young women, who had not given birth and approached the Blessed One and said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Recluse, we will attend to you, at your feet.&ucirc; The Blessed One did not care for those words he sat as though released with the destruction of endearments.</P>
<P>8. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra went to a side and discussed, the intentions of man rise and fall, what if each one of us, create the forms of one hundred young women who have given birth.</P>
<P>Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra, each one of them, created the forms of one hundred young women, who had given birth and approached the Blessed One and said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Recluse, we will attend to you, at your feet.&ucirc; The Blessed One did not care for those words he sat as though released with the destruction of endearments.</P>
<P>9. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra went to a side and discussed, the intentions of man rise and fall, what if each one of us, create the forms of one hundred young women who have given birth twice</P>
<P>Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra, each one of them, created the forms of one hundred young women, who had not given birth twice and approached the Blessed One and said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Recluse, we will attend to you, at your feet.&ucirc; The Blessed One did not care for those words he sat as though released with the destruction of endearments.</P>
<P>10. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra went to a side and discussed, the intentions of man rise and fall, what if each one of us, create the forms of one hundred middle aged women.</P>
<P>Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra, each one of them, created the forms of one hundred middle aged women, and approached the Blessed One and said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Recluse, we will attend to you, at your feet.&ucirc; The Blessed One did not care for those words he sat as though released with the destruction of endearments.</P>
<P>11. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra went to a side and discussed, the intentions of man rise and fall, what if each one of us, create the forms of one hundred aged women.</P>
<P>Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra, each one of them, created the forms of one hundred aged women and approached the Blessed One and said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Recluse, we will attend to you, at your feet.&ucirc; The Blessed One did not care for those words he sat as though released with the destruction of endearments.</P>
<P>12. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra went to a side and discussed, what our father say is true.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;It's not easy to bring the Perfect, Well Gone One, with passion.<BR>
He has gone beyond the domains of Death, therefore we grieve much.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>13. If we had attacked a recluse or Brahmin free of greed in this manner, his heart would have split and he would have vomited warm blood, or else he would have gone off his mind, or his mind would have been deranged. It would be like a green reed that had withered, dried and died. In the same manner the recluse or Brahmin would wither, dry and become pale.</P>
<P>14. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion the three daughters of M&agrave;ra approached the Blessed One and stood on a side.</P>
<P>15. Then Craving the daughter of M&agrave;ra said these stanzas to the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;&szlig;Is it overcome with grief that you concentrate in forests?<BR>
Or is it the decrease of the mind and wishing for it?<BR>
Or have you done any offence in the village?<BR>
Why don't people see what you're doing?<BR>
It's witness you have no prosperity&ucirc;</P>
<P>16. &szlig;I have come to the essence, my mind is appeased,<BR>
I am victorious over beloved, agreeable, matter.<BR>
I have realized pleasantness and concentrate alone,<BR>
Therefore I do not make friends with people<BR>
It's witness, I have no prosperity.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>17. Then Disinterest the daughter of M&agrave;ra said a stanza to the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Abiding in what does the bhikkhu, spend much of his time?<BR>
That he crossed the five tides and also the sixth<BR>
Thinking of what does the sensual perception grow?<BR>
That the externals are not the gainers of it?&ucirc;</P>
<P>18. &szlig;With appeased body and well released mind,<BR>
Without intentions, mindful of singleness,<BR>
Knowing how to concentrate without thoughts<BR>
Does not become angry, does not recall and is not hard.<BR>
The bhikkhu spends much of his time abiding thus<BR>
And crosses the five tides and also the sixth<BR>
Not concentrating thus, the sensual perception grows<BR>
And the externals are not the gainers of it.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>19. Then Passion the daughter of M&agrave;ra said a stanza of appeasement in the presence of the Blessed One:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Without destroying craving crowds, come together and behave,<BR>
Many teachers too, will behave in this manner.<BR>
Many go homeless in this manner,<BR>
You crossed over the domains of Death.&ucirc;</P>
<P>20. &szlig;Indeed, Thus Gone Ones, with the right Teaching, lead out great heroes,<BR>
When led by the Teaching how could they be misled through envy?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>21. Then Craving, Disinterest and Passion, the three daughters of M&agrave;ra approached M&agrave;ra the evil one.</P>
<P>22. M&agrave;ra, the evil one saw Craving, Disinterest and Passion, the daughters of the evil one, coming in the distance and said this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Foolish ones, you crush the rock with lotus stalks.<BR>
Dig the rock with nails, destroy iron, with teeth.<BR>
Like carrying a mountain on the head,<BR>
Do you wish to fathom the abyss?<BR>
Like destruction, to soil the heart, you pierced Gotama.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>23. Craving, Disinterest and Passion came blazing, to push away the Teacher. He pushed them away like the wind pushing away the measure.</P>
