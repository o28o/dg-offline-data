<P>9. 1. 1.</P>
<P>(1) Viveka &Yacute; Seclusion</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time a certain bhikkhu lived in a stretch of forest in the country of Kosala.</P>
<P>2. The bhikkhu, at that time, in his seclusion during the day time thought worldly thoughts of demerit.</P>
<P>3. A deity living in that stretch of forest out of compassion, wishing to arouse remorse, approached him.</P>
<P>4. Having approached said these stanzas:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;You entered the forest desiring seclusion, but your mind goes out.<BR>
People should tame their interests, dispel greed and become pleasant<BR>
Dispel discontent mindfully and be mindful of the essential.<BR>
The under current of demerit is difficult to dispel.<BR>
Do not recall that sensual dust<BR>
Like the crow in search of dirt,<BR>
Quietly fly away clinging to dirt<BR>
Even so the bhikkhu mindfully making endeavor<BR>
Quietly removes his attachment to lust.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>5. The bhikkhu made remorseful by that deity became concerned about his welfare.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>9. 1. 2.</P>
<P>(2) U&ntilde;&ntilde;hana &Yacute; Waking Up</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time a certain bhikkhu lived in a stretch of forest in the country of Kosala.</P>
<P>2. The bhikkhu, at that time, in his seclusion during the day time fell asleep.</P>
<P>3. A deity living in that stretch of forest out of compassion, wishing to arouse remorse, approached him.</P>
<P>4. Having approached, said these stanzas:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Wake up bhikkhu, what is the use of sleeping?<BR>
Why should you sleep while ailing with the shot arrow?<BR>
You became homeless out of faith, develop that faith<BR>
Do not be overcome with sleepiness.&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Sensuality is impermanent, it fades, the foolish are infatuated in it<BR>
It's to be freed from bonds and clinging, the gone forth make endeavor.<BR>
To tame interest and greed, to see the end of ignorance,<BR>
And to purify that knowledge, the gone forth make endeavor.<BR>
Breaking up ignorance with science and finishing up desires<BR>
To be without grief and worries, the gone forth make endeavor.<BR>
With aroused effort to dispel, and constantly zealous to gain it,<BR>
Aiming extinction as the goal the gone forth make endeavor.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(3) Kassapagotta or Cheta &Yacute; Venerable Kassapagotta</P>
<P>I heard thus. At one time a certain bhikkhu lived in a stretch of forest in the country of Kosala.</P>
<P>2. The bhikkhu, at that time, gone to his seclusion advised a leopard.</P>
<P>3. A deity living in that stretch of forest out of compassion, wishing to arouse remorse, approached him.</P>
<P>4. Having approached said these stanzas:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Bhikkhu, leopards living in the mountains are not wise and do not think<BR>
It's not suitable to advise it, I think you are foolish.<BR>
It listens but does not know, looks but does not see you<BR>
The foolish do not know and you cannot seize them with righteousness.<BR>
If in day light Kassapa is carried away, he will not see forms,<BR>
And we will not see him.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>5. Then venerable Kassapagotta made remorseful by the deity became concerned.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>9. 1. 4.</P>

<P>1. I heard thus. At one time many bhikkhus lived in a stretch of forest in the country of Kosala.</P>
<P>2. Those bhikkhus, having spent the rains and at the end of the three months went on a tour.</P>
<P>3. Then a deity living in that stretch of forest not seeing those bhikkhus lamenting about their absence said this stanza:</P><DIR>

They looked attractive and learned,<BR>
Where have the disciples of Gotama gone?</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>4. Hearing this another deity said this stanza:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Some went to Magadha, some to Kosala,<BR>

<DIR>

<P>&szlig;You have come to a place where there are many roots of trees<BR>
Arouse interest for extinction, disciple of Gotama concentrate<BR>
Do not be negligent. What is the use of talking all the time?&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<P>&szlig;Establish, your mind there, where you lived earlier<BR>
In the heaven of the thirty-three, all sensual pleasures prosper.<BR>
You will look beautiful attended by celestial nymphs.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Celestial nymphs established in a self are fallen into unpleasantness<BR>
And those who wish for celestial nymphs are also in unpleasantness.&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. &szlig;They that do not see Nandana, do not know pleasure<BR>
It is the home of the king of gods, the fame of the thirty.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(Anuruddha:)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>6. &szlig;Foolish woman, you do not esteem of the words of the worthy<BR>
All determinations are impermanent, they rise and fade,<BR>
Arisen, they cease, their complete surcease is bliss<BR>
Jalini, I have no more settlements with heavenly bodies<BR>
I have ended my journey in existences, there is no more rebirth for me.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<DIR>

<P>&szlig;All night you think of the river bank. People say,<BR>
Why is he going up and down the bank of the river?<BR>
There are many impedimental sounds<BR>
That should be endured by the ascetic.<BR>
By those sounds you should not be bewildered or wearied<BR>
Wild animals in the forest tremble because of sounds<BR>
Ignore those sounds, they do not come to your sphere.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>

<DIR>

<P>&szlig;I live alone in this forest, like wood thrown away.<BR>
It's such an enjoyable night, on account of whose demerit is it?&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<P>4. H&agrave;ving approached said these stanzas to that bhikkhu:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Bhikkhu, why do you not give the Teaching to the bhikkhus living with you?<BR>
Hearing the Teaching you recite, we delight here and now.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Earlier I had an interest to recite, now that interest has faded<BR>

<DIR>

<P>3. Having approached said these stanzas:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;The early disciples of Gotama lived peaceful lives<BR>
Not longing for special, morsel food, beds or seats.<BR>
Knowing impermanence in the world,<BR>
They made an end of unpleasantness<BR>
You make yourself difficult to nourish, like the headmen in the village,<BR>
Eating the stomach's fill, you are swooned in other's houses.<BR>
I clasp my hands to the Community and say these words.<BR>
Those soiled are lost! Like those dead and gone.<BR>
I venerate the diligent bhikkhus.&ucirc;</P></DIR>

<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Do you inhale the scent of this lotus not offered to you?<BR>
It is a kind of theft. Sir, you are after scents.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(Bhikkhu:)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>5. &szlig;I do not carry it away, nor do I pluck it, inhale the scent staying away from it.<BR>
Lotus roots are dug and lotuses are plucked, why is that disaster not mentioned?&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(Deity:)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>6. &szlig;A man with blood in his hands would wear a soiled cloth,<BR>
Therefore I have no words for you. I go, my duty done.<BR>
To a blameless man, constantly in search of purity,<BR>
Even the tail end of some demerit, seems monstrous.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(Bhikkhu:)</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>7. &szlig;Indeed the non human knows me, therefore is compassionate to me<BR>
Non human, seeing faults like these in me in the future,<BR>
Do not let me live with them, do it for no wages.&ucirc;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(Deity:)</P><DIR>
<DIR>
