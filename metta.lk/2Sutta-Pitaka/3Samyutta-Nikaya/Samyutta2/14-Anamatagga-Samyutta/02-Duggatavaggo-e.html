<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha.</P>
<P>2. Then about thirty monks from Pava, all of them forest dwellers, dependants on morsel food, wearers of rag robes limited to three and all with bonds approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side.</P>
<P>3. Then it occurred to the Blessed One: &szlig;These thirty monks from Pava, are all forest dwellers, dependants on morsel food, wearers of rag robes limited to three and all with bonds. What if I teach them, so that their minds would be released from desires without holdings while sitting in these same seats?&ucirc;</P>

<P>6. &szlig;Monks, what is more, the blood you have shed on account of the neck being severed from the body in this long journey in existences running from one existence to another, or the water in the four great oceans?&ucirc;</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Venerable sir, as the Blessed One has taught us the blood we have shed on account of the neck being severed from the body in this long journey in existences running from one existence to another, is more than the water in the four great oceans.&ucirc;</P>

<DIR>

<P>The Pac&atilde;navamsa belonged to the Tivaras.<BR>
Vankaka belonged to the Rohitas<BR>
Supassa belonged to the Suppiyas<BR>
And Vepulla to the Magadhans<BR>
Indeed, determinations are impermanent,<BR>
Their nature is to rise and fall.<BR>
They rise and then fall,<BR>
Their surcease is bliss.&ucirc;</P>
