<P>18. 1. 1.</P>
<P>(1) A&ntilde;&ntilde;ipesi &Yacute; Bones And A Lump of Flesh</P>
<P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha.</P>
<P>2. At that time venerable Lakkha&otilde;a and venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na were living in the peaks of the Gijjha rock.</P>
<P>3. Venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na wearing robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes approached venerable Lakkha&otilde;a.</P>
<P>4. Approaching said to venerable Lakkha&otilde;a: &szlig;Friend Lakkha&otilde;a, let us enter Rajagaha for alms.&ucirc; Venerable Lakkha&otilde;a said: &szlig;Yes, friend.&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. Venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na while descending from the Gijjha peak, smiled at a certain spot.</P>
<P>6. Then venerable Lakkha&otilde;a said to venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na: &szlig;Friend, Moggall&agrave;na, for what reasson did you smile?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Friend, Lakkha&otilde;a, this is not the right time to ask that question. Ask that question in the presence of the Blessed One.&ucirc;</P>
<P>7. Then venerable Lakkha&otilde;a and venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na went the alms round in Rajagaha. After partaking the meal and returning from the alms round approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side.</P>
<P>8. Sitting on a side venerable Lakkha&otilde;a said to venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na: &szlig;Friend Moggall&agrave;na, when descending from the Gijjha peak you smiled at a certain spot, for what reason did you smile?&ucirc;</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Friend, when I was descending the Gijjha peak, I saw a skeleton moving in space and it was followed and attacked by vultures, crows, and hawks, and they pull a rib from it and divide it among them, and the skeleton gives a cry of distress.</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Friend, then it occurred to me: `Indeed it is wonderful and surprising to see a being, a non-human, a gain of self like this.&ucirc;'</P>
<P>11. Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: &szlig;Monks, the disciple should live wisely with aroused knowledge, when he knows, sees or witnesses such a thing.</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Monks, in the past I saw this being, yet I did not tell it to anyone. If I had told, others would not believe me and it would be for their ill being and unpleasantness for a long time.</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Monks, this person was a slaughterer of cattle in this same Rajagaha. As a result of that action he suffered in hell for many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many hundred thousands of years. And as a result of that action suffers, having gained that self.&ucirc;</P>
