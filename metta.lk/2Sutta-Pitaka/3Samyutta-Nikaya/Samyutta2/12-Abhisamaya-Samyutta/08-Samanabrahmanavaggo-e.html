<P>(71) Jar&agrave;mara&otilde;a &Yacute; Decay and Death</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>

<P>3. &szlig;Monks, whoever recluses and brahmins who do not know decay and death, the arising of decay and death, the cessation of decay and death and the path leading to the cessation of decay and death they are not my recluses or brahmins. Among recluses they cannot be reckoned as recluses, among brahmins they have not attained to the state of brahmins. And they will not attain to the state of a recluse or become a brahmin in this life.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Monks, whoever recluses and brahmins know decay and death, the arising of decay and death, the cessation of decay and death and the path leading to the cessation of decay and death, are my recluses and brahmins. Among recluses they can be reckoned as recluses, among brahmins they have attained to the state of brahmins. And they will attain to the state of a recluse or become a brahmin in this life.&ucirc;</P>
