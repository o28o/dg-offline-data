<P>(41) Pa¤caverabhaya I &Yacute; The Five Fears I</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">I</P>
<P>2. The householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side.</P>
<P>The Blessed One said thus to the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika:</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Householder, when the five dreadful fears are appeased and if you are endowed with the four factors of one who has entered the stream of the Teaching and if you wisely see and penetrate the right path, if you desire, could declare, `I have destroyed births in hells, in animal wombs, in the sphere of ghosts and birth in loss, evil states and in decrease. I have entered the stream of the Teaching, would not fall from there and am sure of enlightenment.'</P>
<P>4. &szlig;What are the five dreadful fears that are appeased?</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Householder, a destroyer of living things is in fear of having destroyed living things in this life and he dreads and fears the next and experiences mental unpleasantness and displeasure. Someone abstaining from destroying living things is appeased from this dread and fear.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Householder, one who has taken the not given is in fear of having taken the not given and he dreads and fears and experiences mental unpleasantness and displeasure in this life and the next. Someone abstaining from taking the not given is appeased from this dread and fear.</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Householder, one misbehaving sexually is in fear of having misbehaved sexually and experiences mental unpleasantness and displeasure in this life and the next. Someone abstaining from misbehaving sexually is appeased from this dread and fear.</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Householder, someone telling lies is in fear of having told lies and he dreads and fears and experiences mental unpleasantness and displeasure in this life and the next. Someone abstaining from telling lies is appeased from this dread and fear.</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Householder, someone taking intoxicating drinks is in fear of having taken intoxicating drinks and he dreads and fears experiencing mental unpleasantness and displeasure in this life and the next. Someone abstaining from taking intoxicating drinks is appeased from this dread and fear.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">II</P>
<P>10. &szlig;With what four factors is an enterer into the stream of the Teaching endowed?</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Here householder, the noble disciple has unwavering faith in the Blessed One: That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, is incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, Teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Here householder, the noble disciple has unwavering faith in the Teaching. The Blessed One's Teaching is well proclaimed, the results are here and now, time does not matter. Invites inspection, leads inwards and should be personally realized by the wise.</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Here householder, the noble disciple has unwavering faith in the Community of monks. The disciple monks of the Blessed One have entered the right path, the straightforward path, the wise path and the path of mutual understanding. They are the four pairs of the noble eight beings who are reverential, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts and worthy of reverential salutation with clasped hands, the noble field of merit for the world.</P>
<P>14. &szlig;Is endowed with virtues desired by the noble ones. Virtues that are consistent not affected pure and praised by the wise as leading to concentration,.</P>
<P>15. &szlig;How is the right path seen and penetrated by him wisely?</P>
<P>16. &szlig;Here, householder the noble disciple wisely considers this same dependent arising. When this is present, this comes to be. When this arises this arises. When this is not present, this does not come to be. With the cessation of this, this cease.</P>
<P>17. &szlig;Such as on account of ignorance arise determinations. On account of determinations arise consciousness. Thus arises the complete mass of unpleasantness. With the cessation of ignorance without anything remaining, determinations cease. With the cessation of determinations, consciousness cease. Thus cease the complete mass of unpleasantness.</P>
<P>&szlig;This to him is seeing and penetrating the right path wisely.</P>
<P>18. &szlig;Householder, when the noble disciple has appeased these five dreadful fears and is endowed with the four factors of one who has entered the stream of the Teaching and has wisely seen and penetrated the right path, if he desires could declare, `I have destroyed births in hells, in animal wombs, in the sphere of ghosts and birth in loss, evil states and in decrease.
