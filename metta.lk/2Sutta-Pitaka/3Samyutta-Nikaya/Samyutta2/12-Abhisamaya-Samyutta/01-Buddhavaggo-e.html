<P>12. 1. 1.</P>
<P>(1) Desana (Pa&ntilde;iccasamupp&agrave;da) &Yacute; Exposition (Dependent Arising)</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. From there the Blessed One addressed the monks: &szlig;Monks!&ucirc; Those monks replied: &szlig;Yes, venerable sir.&ucirc; And the Blessed One said thus:</P>
<P>&szlig;Monks, I teach you dependent arising, attend and listen carefully.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Those monks replied: &szlig;Yes, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>3. The Blessed One said: &szlig;Monks, what is dependent arising? On account of ignorance arise determinations. On account of determinations arise consciousness. On account of consciousness arise name and matter. On account of name and matter arise the six spheres. On account of the six spheres arise contact. On account of contact arise feelings. On account of feelings arise craving. On account of craving arise seizing. On account of seizing arise being. On account of being arise birth. On account of birth arise decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. And there's the arising of the complete mass of unpleasantness. Monks, to this is called the arising.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;With the fading and cessation of ignorance without a remainder determinations cease. With the cessation of determinations, consciousness cease. With the cessation of consciousness, name and matter cease. With the cessation of name and matter the six spheres cease. With the cessation of the six spheres, contact cease. With the cessation of contact feelings cease. With the cessation of feelings craving cease. With the cessation of craving seizing cease. With the cessation of seizing being ceases. With the cessation of being, birth ceases. With the cessation of birth, cease decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. Thus ceases, the complete mass of unpleasantness.&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. The Blessed One said thus and those monks delighted in the words of the Blessed One.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>12. 1. 2.</P>
<P>(2) Vibha&iuml;ga &Yacute; Explanation</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. From there the Blessed One addressed the monks: &szlig;Monks!&ucirc; Those monks replied: &szlig;Yes, venerable sir.&ucirc; And the Blessed One said thus:</P>
<P>&szlig;Monks, I teach and explain to you dependent arising, attend and listen carefully.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Those monks replied: &szlig;Yes, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>3. The Blessed One said: &szlig;Monks, what is dependent arising? On account of ignorance arise determinations. On account of determinations arise consciousness. On account of consciousness arise name and matter. On account of name and matter arise the six spheres. On account of the six spheres arise contact. On account of contact arise feelings. On account of feelings arise craving. On account of craving arise seizing. On account of seizing arise being. On account of being arise birth. On account of birth arise decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness displeasure and distress. Thus arises the complete mass of unpleasantness.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Monks, what is decay and death?</P>
<P>&szlig;The decay seen in this and other categories of beings in the form of broken teeth, signs of age, grey hair wrinkled skin, decrease of the life span, the decay of the mental faculties. This is called decay.</P>
<P>&szlig;The disappearing, moving away, breaking up, non evidence in time, the breaking up of the masses and laying down of the carcass of this and other categories of beings is called death. Monks, that decay and this death is called decay and death.</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Monks, what is birth? The birth, growth, appearance, rebirth, the manifestation of the masses, and the gain of the spheres of this and other category of beings is called birth.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Monks, what is being? Monks, being is threefold. It is the prevalence in thoughts in sensuality, in material states and in immaterial states. Monks, this is called being.</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Monks, what is holding? Monks, the mind's way of holding is fourfold. That is holding to sensuality, holding to views, sticking to virtues and seizing a view of a self. Monks, these are the four ways of holding.</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Monks, what is craving? Monks, there are six masses of craving. Someone craves for forms, for sounds, for scents, for tastes, for touches and for ideas. Monks, these are the six masses of craving.</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Monks, what is feeling? Monks, there are six bodies of feelings. Feelings arising to someone through eye-contact, through ear contact, through nose contact, through tongue contact, through body contact and through mind contact. Monks, these are the six bodies of feelings.</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Monks, what is contact? Monks, there are six bodies of contact. The contact of eye, the contact of ear, the contact of nose, the contact of the tongue, the contact of the body and the contact of mind. These are the six bodies of contact.</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Monks, what are the six spheres? It is the sphere of the eye, sphere of the ear, sphere of the nose, sphere of the tongue, sphere of the body and the sphere of the mind. Monks, these are the six spheres.</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Monks, what is name and matter? Feelings, perceptions, intentions, contact and mental attention are name. The four great elements and this form seized from them as me or mine is matter. And this name and this matter form name and matter.</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Monks, what is consciousness? There are six bodies of consciousness. They are eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose &Yacute; consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body &Yacute; consciousness and mind-consciousness. These are the six bodies of consciousness.</P>
<P>14. &szlig;Monks, what are determinations? Monks, determinations are threefold as bodily determinations, verbal determinations and mental determinations. These are the threefold determinations.</P>
<P>15. &szlig;Monks, what is ignorance? Monks, if someone does not know unpleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, the cessation of unpleasantness and the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. To that is said ignorance.</P>
<P>16. &szlig;Thus, monks, on account of ignorance arise determinations, on account of determinations arise consciousness ... re ... Thus the complete mass of unpleasantness, arise. With the cessation of ignorance without a remainder, determinations cease. With the cessation of determinations, consciousness ceases ... re ... Thus comes about the cessation of the complete mass of unpleasantness.&ucirc;</P>

<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. &szlig;Monks, I will teach you the wrong method and the right method be attentive and listen carefully to it.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Those monks replied: &szlig;Yes, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Monks, what is the wrong method? On account of ignorance arise determinations. On account of determinations arise consciousness. On account of consciousness arise name and matter. On account of name and matter arise the six spheres. On account of the six spheres arise contact. On account of contact arise feelings. On account of feelings arise craving. On account of craving arise seizing. On account of seizing arise being. On account of being arise birth. On account of birth arise decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness and displeasure and distress. Thus is the arising of the complete mass of unpleasantness. Monks, to this is called the wrong method.</P>
<P>&szlig;Monks, what is the right method?</P>
<P>&szlig;With the fading and cessation of ignorance without a remainder determinations cease. With the cessation of determinations, consciousness cease. With the cessation of consciousness, name and matter cease. With the cessation of name and matter the six spheres cease. With the cessation of the six spheres, contact cease. With the cessation of contact feelings cease. With the cessation of feelings craving cease. With the cessation of craving seizing cease. With the ceasing of holding being cease. With the cessation of being, birth cease. With the cessation of birth, cease decay, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. Thus cease, the complete mass of unpleasantness Monks, to this is called the right method.</P>
