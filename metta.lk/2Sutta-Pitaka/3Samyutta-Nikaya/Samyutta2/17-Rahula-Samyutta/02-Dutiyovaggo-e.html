<P>17. 2. 1.</P>
<P>(11) Cakkhu &Yacute; The Eye</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. Then venerable R&agrave;hula approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side.</P>
<P>3. The Blessed One said thus to venerable R&agrave;hula who was seated on a side:</P>
<P>&szlig;R&agrave;hula, is the eye permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;It's impermanent, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;That which is impermanent is it unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;It's unpleasant, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. &szlig;That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it suitable to be considered, `that is mine, I am that, it's my self?'&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That is not so, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>6- 17. &szlig;R&agrave;hula, is the ear ... re ... nose ... re ... tongue ... re ... the body ... re ...</P>
<P>18. Is the mind permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;It's impermanent, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>19. &szlig;That which is impermanent is it unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;It's unpleasant, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>20. &szlig;That which is impermanent, unpleasant, a changing thing is it suitable to be considered, `that is mine, I am that, it's my self?'&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That is not so, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>21. &szlig;R&agrave;hula, the noble disciple seeing it thus turns away from the eye, turns away from the ear, turns away from the nose, turns away from the tongue, turns away from the body and turns away from the mind.</P>
<P>22. &szlig;Turning away, detaches himself, is dispassionate, and is released. Released, knowledge arises, `Birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, duties are done, there's nothing more to wish'.&ucirc;</P>
