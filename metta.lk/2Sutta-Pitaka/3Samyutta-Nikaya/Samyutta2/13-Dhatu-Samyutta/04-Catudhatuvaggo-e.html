<P>(30) Catusso &THORN; Four Elements</P>
<P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;.</P>
<P>2. &szlig;Bhikkhus, these four are the elements. What four? They are the element of earth, the element of water, the element of fire and the element of air. These are the four elements.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>13. 4. 2.</P>
<P>(31) Pubbe &THORN; In the Past</P>
<P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;.</P>
<P>2. &szlig;Bhikkhus, in the past, when I was yet an aspirant for enlightenment this occurred to me:</P>
<P>3. &szlig;What is the satisfaction, danger and the escape on account of the earth element? What is the satisfaction, danger and the escape on account of the water element? What is the satisfaction, danger and the escape on account of the fire element? And what is the satisfaction, danger and the escape on account of the air element?</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Bhikkhus, it occurred to me:</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of the earth element, that is the satisfaction in the earth element. That the earth element is impermanent, unpleasant and a changing thing is the danger in the earth element. Taming the interest and greed for the earth element and dispelling the interest and greed for the earth element is the escape from the earth element.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of the water element, ... re ...</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of the fire element, ... re ...</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of the air element, that is the satisfaction in the air element. That the air element is impermanent, unpleasant and a changing thing is the danger in the air element. Taming the interest and greed for the air element and dispelling the interest and greed for the air element is the escape from the air element.</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Bhikkhus, until I thoroughly understood the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape from these four elements, I did not acknowledge that I have realized the incomparable rightful enlightenment to gods and men together with M&agrave;ra and Brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins.</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Bhikkhus, when I thoroughly understood as it really is, the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape from these four elements, I acknowledged that I have realized the incomparable rightful enlightenment to gods and men together with M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins.</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Knowledge too arose to me, the release of my mind is unshakeable, this is my last birth, there is no more re-birth.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>13. 4. 3.</P>

<P>3. &szlig;Bhikkhus, I wandered searching the danger in the earth element. Whatever danger there is in the earth element, I understood it. I have wisely and thoroughly seen the danger in the earth element.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Bhikkhus, I wandered searching the escape from the earth element. Whatever escape there is in the earth element, I understood it. I have wisely and thoroughly seen the escape from the earth element.</P>

<P>13. &szlig;Bhikkhus, I wandered searching the escape from the earth element. Whatever escape there is in the earth element, I understood it. I have wisely and thoroughly seen the escape from the earth element.</P>
<P>14. &szlig;Bhikkhus, until I thoroughly understood the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape from these four elements, I did not acknowledge that I have realized the incomparable rightful enlightenment to gods and men together with M&agrave;ra and Brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins.</P>

<P>2. &szlig;Bhikkhus, if there was no satisfaction in the earth element, beings would not have embraced the earth element. As there is a satisfaction in the earth element, beings embrace the earth element.</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Bhikkhus, if there was no danger in the earth element, beings would not have turned away from the earth element. As there is a danger in the earth element, beings turn away from the earth element.</P>

<P>14. &szlig;Bhikkhus, until beings thoroughly understood the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape from these four elements, they did not live with an unrestricted mind, that has given up, detached and dissociated from the world, together with its gods, M&agrave;ra Brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins.</P>
