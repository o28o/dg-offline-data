<P>(11) Sattim&agrave;dh&agrave;tu &Yacute; These Seven are the Elements</P>
<P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;.</P>
<P>2. &szlig;Bhikkhus, these seven are the elements.</P>
<P>&szlig;What seven? The element of luster, the element of pleasantness, the element of the sphere of space, the element of the sphere of consciousness, the element of the sphere of nothingness, the element of the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, and the element of the cessation of perceptions and feelings. Bhikkhus, these are the seven elements.&ucirc;</P>
<P>3. When this was said a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: &szlig;Venerable sir, on what perspective are these elements of luster, splendor, space, consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception and the cessation of perceptions and feelings pointed out?&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Bhikkhu, the element `luster' is pointed out on the perspective of darkness.</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Bhikkhu, the element `the sphere of pleasantness' is pointed out on the perspective of unpleasantness.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Bhikkhu, the element `the sphere of space' is pointed out on the perspective of forms.</P>

<P>11. &szlig;Venerable sir, in what attainments should these elements of luster, splendor, space, consciousness, nothingness, neither perception nor non-perception and the cessation of perceptions and feelings be reached?&ucirc;</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Bhikkhu, the elements of luster, pleasantness, the sphere of space, the sphere of consciousness and the sphere of nothingness should be reached through the perceptive attainments.</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Bhikkhu, the element `neither perception nor nonperception' should be reached in the attainment of the remaining determinations.</P>

<P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatth&atilde;.</P>

<P>7. &szlig;Bhikkhus, like a man who has dropped a burning torch in a dried up grassland, had not quickly extinguished it with hands or feet, by that the living things in the dried up grass would come to distress and destruction,</P>
<P>8. &szlig;In the same manner bhikkhus, whoever recluses or brahmins did not quickly dispel, chase away, destroy and made not to arise again, arisen disagreeable perceptions are here and now in trouble, with worries with burning and after death they could expect decrease.</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Bhikkhus, non-sensual thoughts arise with a reason, not without. Non-angry thoughts arise with a reason, not without. Non-hurting thoughts arise with a reason, not without.</P>

On account of non-angry thoughts arise the interest to be not angry. On account of the interest to be not angry arise no burnings of anger.

On account of not-hurting thoughts arise the interest to not hurt On account of the not hurting interest arise a burning to not hurt On account of the burning, to not hurt, there is a search to not hurt. Bhikkhus, in the search to not hurt the learned noble disciple, in three instances falls to the right method, by body, words and mind.</P>
<P>14. &szlig;Bhikkhua, like a man who has dropped a burning torch in a dried up grassland, had quickly extinguished it with hands or feet, by that the living things in the dried up grass would not come to distress and destruction,</P>
<P>15. &szlig;In the same manner bhikkhus, whoever recluses or brahmins quickly dispelled, chased away, destroyed and made not to arise again, arisen disagreeable perceptions are here and now not in trouble, without worries without burning and after death they could expect increase.</P>

<P>5. &szlig;Kacc&agrave;yana, of elements, the element of ignorance is the worst.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Kacc&agrave;yana, on account of the inferior element arise inferior perceptions, inferior views, inferior thoughts, inferior intentions, inferior aspirations and an inferior person is born with inferior words, he explains, teaches, points out, establishes and makes clear the inferior.
