<P>16. 1. 1.</P>
<P>(1) D&agrave;ru&otilde;o &Yacute; Cruel</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the monks from there.</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks, gain, honor and fame are severe, cruel and dangerous for him who wants to end unpleasantness.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Therefore, monks, you should train thus: `We will get rid of arisen gain, honor and fame. Arisen gain, honor and fame will not take control of our minds.'</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Monks, you should train in this manner.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>16. 1. 2.</P>
<P>(2) Balisa&uuml; &Yacute; Bait</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the monks from there. &szlig;Monks, gain, honor and fame are severe, cruel and dangerous for him who wants to end unpleasantness.</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks, like the fish greedy for matter would swallow the bait thrown into deep water, would come to misfortune and disaster in the hands of the fisherman.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Monks, fisherman is a synonym for Death and bait is a synonym for gain, honor and fame.</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Monks, whoever monk enjoys and desires gain honor and fame, is said, has swallowed Death's bait and would come to misfortune and disaster in the hands of Death, the Evil One.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Monks, gain, honor and fame are severe, cruel and dangerous for him who wants to end unpleasantness.</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Therefore, monks, you should train thus: `We will get rid of arisen gain, honor and fame. Arisen gain, honor and fame will not take control of our minds.'</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Monks, you should train in this manner.&ucirc;</P>

<P>(3) Kumma &Yacute; A Tortoise</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the monks from there. &szlig;Monks, gain, honor and fame are severe, cruel and dangerous for him who wants to end unpleasantness.</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks, in the past a large clan of tortoises continually lived in a certain deep water hole.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Monks, a certain tortoise said to another tortoise: `Dear one, do not go to that region.&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. &szlig;That tortoise went to that region and the hunter shot him to fall forward.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Then that tortoise approached his clan.</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Seeing him approaching in the distance the other tortoise said: `Dear one, didn't you go to that region?'</P>
<P>`Dear tortoise, I went to that region.'</P>
<P>8. `Dear one, aren't you harmed and destroyed?'</P>
<P>`Am not harmed or destroyed, yet there is this cord which follows me close.'</P>
<P>9. `Dear tortoise, there, you are harmed and destroyed. In this same manner your father and grandfather were harmed and destroyed. Dear tortoise, go away! Now you do not belong here.'</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Monks, hunter is a synonym for Death, the Evil One. To fall forward is a synonym for gain, honor and fame. The cord is a synonym for interest and greed.</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Monks, when the monk enjoys and desires gain honor and fame, it is said that he has greedily fallen forward and is harmed and destroyed and has fallen into the hands of Death.</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Monks, gain, honor and fame are severe, cruel and dangerous for him who wants to end unpleasantness.</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Therefore, monks, you should train thus: `We will get rid of arisen gain, honor and fame. Arisen gain, honor and fame will not take control of our minds.' Monks, you should train in this manner.&ucirc;</P>

<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the monks from there. &szlig;Monks, gain, honor and fame are severe, cruel and dangerous for him who wants to end unpleasantness.</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks, when the goat with long fleece enters a thicket with thorns, she gets entangled, seized, bound, harmed and destroyed here and there.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;In the same manner, monks, a certain monk with a mind consumed and overpowered by gain, honor and fame wears robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes enters a village or hamlet for alms food. And he gets entangled, seized, bound, harmed and destroyed here and there.</P>

<P>3. &szlig;Monks, the dung beetle is covered with dung, full of dung and has a heap of dung in front of him.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;And it belittles other dung beetles saying `I am covered with dung, full of dung, and have a heap of dung in front of me.'</P>
<P>5. &szlig;In the same manner, monks a certain monk with a mind consumed and overpowered by gain, honor and fame wears robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes enters a village or hamlet for alms food. There he partakes all the food offered to him, is invited for the next day and his bowl is also full.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;He returns to the monastery and boasts in front of the monks. `I partook food as much as I was offered, am invited for the next day and my bowl is also full. I am a gainer of robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. These other monks are not so lucky, not capable not the gainers of robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill.'</P>
<P>7. &szlig;That monk with a mind consumed and overpowered by gain, honor and fame belittles other well behaved monks. Monks, it will be for the undoing and unpleasantness of that foolish man for a long time.</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Monks, gain, honor and fame are severe, cruel and dangerous for him who wants to end unpleasantness.</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Therefore, monks, you should train thus: `We will get rid of arisen gain, honor and fame. Arisen gain, honor and fame will not take control of our minds.' Monks, you should train in this manner.&ucirc;</P>

<P>4. &szlig;Monks, the decayed jackal suffering from a disease called erected ears is not happy in a hiding, at the root of a tree or even in open space. Wherever it goes, stands, sits or lies, comes to harm and destruction.</P>
