(13) Sambodhena 1 &Yacute; With Enlightenment</P>
</B><P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. The Blessed One addressed the monks from there.</P>
<P>2. &szlig;Monks, when I was seeking enlightenment it occurred to me what is the satisfaction of the eye, the danger of the eye and the escape from the eye?</P>
<P>&szlig;What is the satisfaction of the ear, the danger of the ear, and the escape from the ear?</P>
<P>&szlig;What is the satisfaction of the nose, the danger of the nose and the escape from the nose?</P>
<P>&szlig;What is the satisfaction of the tongue, the danger of the tongue and the escape from the tongue?</P>
<P>&szlig;What is the satisfaction of the body, the danger of the body, and the escape from the body?</P>
<P>&szlig;What is the satisfaction of the mind, the danger of the mind and the escape from the mind?</P>
<P>3&Yacute;5. &szlig;Monks, it occurred to me thus. Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of the eye is its satisfaction. The eye is impermanent, unpleasant and subject to change is the danger of the eye. The taming of interest and greed for the eye and dispelling interest and greed for the eye is the escape from the eye. Repeat for the ear and nose.</P>
<P>6&Yacute;7. &szlig;Monks, whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of the tongue is its satisfaction. The tongue is impermanent, unpleasant and subject to change, is the danger of the tongue. Taming of interest and greed for the tongue and dispelling interest and greed for the tongue is the escape from the tongue. Repeat for the body.</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of the mind is its satisfaction. The mind is impermanent, unpleasant and subject to change, is the danger of the mind. Taming interest and greed for the mind and dispelling interest and greed for the mind is the escape from the mind.</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Monks, until I realized the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape, of these six personal spheres, I did not acknowledge my rightful, noble enlightenment to the world together with the gods Maras, Brahmas and the Community of recluses and brahmins.</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Monks, when I realized the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape, of these six personal spheres, I declared my rightful, noble enlightenment to the world together with the gods Maras, Brahmas and the Community of recluses and brahmins. .</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Then knowledge and insight arose to me, the release of my mind became steadfast. This is my last birth. I will not be born again.&ucirc;<BR>
