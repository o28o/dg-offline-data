(127) Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja &Yacute; Venerable Pi&otilde;&oacute;ola Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja</P>
</B><P>1. At one time venerable Pi&otilde;&oacute;ola Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja lived in Kosambi in the monastery offered by Ghosita.</P>
<P>2. Then king Udena approached venerable Pi&otilde;&oacute;ola Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on side.</P>
<P>3. King Udena sitting on a side said to venerable Pi&otilde;&oacute;ola Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja: &szlig;Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, why do these young monks with black hair, in the prime of youth, not enjoying sensual pleasures devote their life to lead a complete and pure holy life until the end of their lives?&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Great King, the Blessed One who knows and sees is worthy and rightfully enlightened has said: `Monks, think of them who are like your mothers as your mother, of them who are like your sisters as your sister, of them who are like your daughters as your daughter. This is the reason for the young monks with black hair, in the prime of youth, not to enjoy sensual pleasures, to devote their life to lead a complete and pure holy life until the end of their lives.&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, the mind is greedy and even towards a woman of your mother's age, or even towards a woman of your sister's age, greedy thoughts would arise. Is there another reason for these young monks with black hair, in the prime of youth, to not enjoy sensual pleasures, to devote their lives to lead a complete and pure holy life until the end of their lives?&ucirc;</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Great King, the Blessed One who knows and sees is worthy and rightfully enlightened has said: `Come! Monks, reflect this same body up from the feet, down from the top of the head, enclosed with the skin on all sides as filled with impurities. There are in this body, hairs of the head and of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, veins, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, entrails, lower intestines, stomach, excreta, bile, mucus, pus, blood, sweat, oil of the skin, tears, eye-wax, spit, snot, oil of the joints and urine' Great king, this is also a reason for the young monks with black hair, in the prime of youth, not to enjoy sensual pleasures, to devote their lives to lead a complete and pure holy life until the end of their lives.&ucirc;</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, it is easy for monks developed, in the body, virtues, mind and in wisdom to lead a complete and pure holy life until the end of their lives. Yet on a certain day, what is reflected as impure would not reflect as impure to him. Is there another reason for these young monks with black hair, in the prime of youth, to not enjoy sensual pleasures, to devote their lives to lead a complete and pure holy life until the end of their lives?&ucirc;</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Great King, the Blessed One who knows and sees is worthy and rightfully enlightened has said: `Come! Monks, seeing a form you should not take the sign or its details. If it happened that you lived with the mental faculty of the eye unguarded with evil demerit and displeasing covetousness streaming from your mind, fall to the method of guarding your mind and the mental faculty of the eye.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Repeat for the ear, nose, tongue, and body.</P>
<P>&szlig;Monks, cognizing an idea do not take the sign or its details. If it happened that you lived with the mental faculty of the mind unguarded with evil demerit and displeasing covetousness streaming from your mind, you should fall to the method of guarding your mind and the mental faculty of the mind. Great king, this is also a reason for the young monks with black hair, in the prime of youth, not to enjoy sensual pleasures, to devote their lives to lead a complete and pure holy life until the end of their lives.&ucirc;</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Good Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, these words of the Blessed One who knows and sees is worthy and rightfully enlightened are wonderful and surprising. This is the reason for the young monks with black hair, in the prime of youth, not to enjoy sensual pleasures, to devote their lives to lead a complete and pure holy life until the end of their lives.&ucirc;</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Good Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, when I enter the women's quarters bodily, verbally, and mentally unguarded, mindfulness not established and mental faculties unprotected, I enter it with a lot of greed. When I enter the women's quarters bodily, verbally, and mentally guarded, mindfulness established and mental faculties protected, I enter it without a lot of greed.&ucirc;</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Good Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, I understand it! It is like something overturned is reinstated, something covered is made manifest, as though the path was shown to them who have lost their way. It's as though an oil lamp was lighted for those who have their sight to see forms. Good Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja has explained the Teaching in many ways. Now I take refuge in that Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of monks. Good Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja remember me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until my life lasts.&ucirc;<BR>

Venerable sir, how do diverse contacts arise on account of diverse elements and how do diverse feelings arise on account of diverse contacts?&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Here householder, the monk seeing a form knows it is pleasant, knows eye consciousness is pleasant and he knows on account of a pleasant contact is a pleasant feeling. The monk seeing a form knows it is unpleasant, knows the eye consciousness is unpleasant and he knows on account of an unpleasant contact is an unpleasant feeling.

(132) Lohicco &Yacute; The Brahmin Lohicca</P>
</B><P>1. At one time venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na lived in a hut of leaves in a place called the Capricorn's mouth.</P>
<P>2. At that time, some pupils, youngsters of the Brahmin Lohicca had gone to collect firewood and they approached venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na's leaves hut, not entering it they walked around it, passing comments loudly and exchanging jokes among themselves. `These shaven headed menials, recluses born from the feet of Brahma, these carriers of loads are honored, revered, and esteemed!'</P>
<P>3. Then venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na appeared from the leaves hut and said to those youngsters: &szlig;Young men do not make a noise! I will teach you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>When this was said the young men kept silence.</P>
<P>4. Then venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na said these stanzas to them:</P><DIR>

<P>&szlig;In the past too there were virtuous brahmins,<BR>
Who lived guarding their mental doors of contact,<BR>
They abode anger overcome! 1.</P>
<P>Attached to the Teaching,<BR>
They raised their minds, to a higher degree.<BR>
I abide, above the intoxicated by birth<BR>
They live a life of lawlessness. 2</P>
<P>Overcome by anger some punish,<BR>
The infirm and also the firm<BR>
Those with unprotected doors are foolish,<BR>
Birth as human beings, they gained in a dream. 3</P>
<P>Some do not destroy seedlings and plants,<BR>
Bathe early, learn the Brahmin scriptures,<BR>
Wear a rough skin and a dirty head dress,<BR>
Repeating the scriptures is their austerity. 4</P>
<P>They are deceitful, crafty and punishing.<BR>
Gain purity by washing with water.<BR>
This is how they grade themselves.<BR>
They do nothing to develop the mind. 5</P>
<P>The path of purity is concentrating,<BR>
Purifying the mind undisturbed.<BR>
Without hurting any beings,<BR>
Attain that purity. 6</P></DIR>

<P>5. Then those young men angry and displeased approached the Brahmin Lohiccha and said: &szlig;Good one, know this, the recluse Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na in a way depreciates the Brahmin scriptures and abuses them.&ucirc;</P>
<P>The Brahmin Lohiccha hearing this was angry and displeased.</P>
<P>6. Then it occurred to the Brahmin Lohiccha, it is not suitable for one like me, to scold and depreciate the recluse Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na on the words of these young men. I myself should approach him and ask about it.</P>
<P>8. Sitting on a side the Brahmin Lohicca said to venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na: &szlig;Good Kaccana did some of my pupils, come here when they came to fetch fire wood in the forest?</P>
<P>7. Then the Brahmin Lohiccha approached venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na with the young men, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side.</P>
<P>And was there some kind of conversation between good Kaccana and the young men?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;I had some conversation with those young men.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;What was the conversation with the young men and good Kaccana?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Brahmin, this is the conversation I had with the young men. I said:</P><DIR>

<P>&szlig;In the past too, there were virtuous Brahmins,<BR>
Who lived guarding their mental doors of contact,<BR>
They lived their anger overcome. 1.</P>
<P>They were attached to the Teaching,<BR>
And raised their minds, to a higher degree.<BR>
I abide, above the intoxicated by birth,<BR>
Who live a life of lawlessness. 2</P>
<P>Overcome by anger some punish,<BR>
The infirm and also the firm<BR>
Those with unprotected doors are foolish,<BR>
Birth as human beings, they gained in a dream. 3</P>
<P>Some do not destroy seedlings or plants,<BR>
Bathe early, learn the Brahmin scriptures,<BR>
Wear a rough skin and a dirty head dress,<BR>
And repeating the scriptures is their austerity. 4</P>
<P>They are deceitful, crafty and punishing.<BR>
Gain purity by washing with water.<BR>
This is how they grade themselves.<BR>
They do nothing to develop the mind. 5</P>
<P>The path of purity is concentrating,<BR>
Purify the mind undisturbed.<BR>
Without hurting any beings,<BR>
Attain that purity.&ucirc; 6</P></DIR>

<P>9. &szlig;Good Kaccana said `unprotected doors,' how are the doors of mental contact unprotected?&ucirc;</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Here Brahmin, someone seeing a form, indulges in a pleasant form and repulses an unpleasant form and abides with a limited mind, mindfulness not established. There too he does not know the release of mind and the release through wisdom, as it really is, how arisen evil demerit ceases without anything remaining</P>
<P>11&Yacute;14. Hearing a sound &#57389; re &#57389; scenting a smell, &#57389; re &#57389; tasting a savory &#57389; re &#57389; cognizing a touch &#57389; re</P>
<P>15. &szlig;Someone cognizing an idea indulges in a pleasant idea and repulses an unpleasant idea and abides with a limited mind, mindfulness not established. There too he does not know the release of mind and the release through wisdom, as it really is, how arisen evil demerit ceases without anything remaining.</P>
<P>16. &szlig;Brahmin, these are the unprotected doors.&ucirc;</P>
<P>17. &szlig;Wonderful and surprising good Kaccana, you explain the unprotected doors of mental contact as though with unprotected doors of mental contact. Good Kaccana, you said the `protected door,' what is the protected door?&ucirc;</P>
<P>18. &szlig;Here Brahmin, someone seeing a form does not indulge in a pleasant form nor repulses an unpleasant form and abides with an unlimited mind, with established mindfulness. There too he knows the release of mind and the release through wisdom, as it really is, how arisen evil demerit ceases without anything remaining.</P>
<P>19&Yacute;22. &szlig;Hearing a sound &#57389; re &#57389; scenting a smell &#57389; re &#57389; tasting a savory &#57389; re &#57389; cognizing a touch &#57389; re &#57389;</P>
<P>23. &szlig;Someone cognizing an idea does not indulge in a pleasant idea nor repulse an unpleasant idea and abides with an unlimited mind, with established mindfulness. There too he knows the release of mind and the release through wisdom, as it really is how arisen evil demerit ceases without anything remaining.</P>
<P>24. &szlig;Brahmin, these are the protected doors of mental contact.&ucirc;</P>
<P>25. &szlig;Wonderful and surprising good Kaccana, you explain the protected doors of mental contact as though you are with protected doors of mental contact. Good! Kaccana, it's like something overturned is put upright! Some covered thing is made manifest. It is as though the path is shown to someone who has lost his way. It is like lighting an oil lamp for the darkness, so that those who have their sight could see forms. Good Kaccana has explained the Teaching in many ways. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of monks! May good Kaccana think of me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until I live. When good Kaccana approaches the families of lay disciples of the village, mouth of the Capricorn, may you take the opportunity to approach the family of Lohiccha, so that the young boys and girls would get a chance to worship, attend to, prepare a seat or offer some water and that will be for their happiness for a long time!&ucirc;<BR>

When she knew that venerable Ud&agrave;y&atilde; had finished his meal, put away the bowl the Brahmin woman pulled out her shoes, disclosed her head and taking a low seat said: &szlig;Venerable sir, when what is present do the noble ones point out pleasant and unpleasant feelings and when what is not present do the noble ones not point out pleasant and unpleasant feelings?&ucirc;</P>
<P>17. &szlig;Sister, when the eye is present the noble ones point out pleasant and unpleasant feelings. When the eye is not present the noble ones do not point out pleasant and unpleasant feelings. When the ear is present &#57389; re &#57389; the nose is present, &#57389; re &#57389; tongue is present, &#57389; re &#57389; the body is present, the mind is present the noble ones point out pleasant and unpleasant feelings and &#57389; re &#57389; when the mind is not present the noble ones do not point out pleasant and unpleasant feelings.&ucirc;</P>
<P>18. When this was said the Brahmin woman of the Verahacc&agrave;ni family said to venerable Ud&agrave;y&atilde;: &szlig;Venerable sir, now I understand, it's like something overturned is put upright! Some covered thing is made manifest. It is as though the path is shown to someone who has lost his way. It is like lighting an oil lamp for the darkness, so that those who have their sight could see forms. Venerable Ud&agrave;y&atilde; has explained the Teaching in many ways. Now I take refuge in the Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of monks! May venerable Ud&agrave;y&atilde; think of me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until I live.&ucirc;<BR>
