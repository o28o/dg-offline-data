(134) Devadahakhano &Yacute; At Devadaha (The Right Moment)</P>
</B><P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in Devadaha, a hamlet of the Sakyas.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the monks from there: &szlig;Monks, I do not say that all monks should be diligent in the six spheres of mental contact nor do I say that all monks should not be diligent in the six spheres of mental contact.&ucirc;</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Those monks who are worthy have destroyed desires, lived the holy life to the end, done their duties, have put down the weight, attained the highest good, have destroyed the bond `to be' and are released rightfully knowing; to them it is not necessary to say to be diligent in the six doors of mental contact. What is the reason?</P>
<P>4. &szlig;They have done their duties diligently and it is not possible that they be negligent.</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Monks, those monks who are trainees, have not attained their aim yet and abiding with a wish to end unpleasantness, to them I say, should be diligent in the six spheres of mental contact. What is the reason?</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Monks, to them there are pleasant and unpleasant forms cognizable by eye-consciousness with the contact of which, their minds are not taken possession completely, as a result they have unshaken, aroused effort, unconfused mindfulness established, the body composed, not angry and the mind concentrated in one point; seeing immediate results for them, I say they should be diligent in the six doors of mental contact.</P>
<P>7&Yacute;10. Repeat. &szlig;Monks, to them are pleasant and unpleasant sounds, &#57389; re &#57389; scents &#57389; re &#57389; tastes, &#57389; re &#57389; and touches, cognizable by body-consciousness with the contact of which their minds are not taken possession completely, as a result they have unshaken and aroused effort, unconfused mindfulness established, the body composed, not angry and the mind concentrated in one point, seeing immediate results for them, I say they should be diligent in the six doors of mental contact.</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Monks, to them are pleasant and unpleasant ideas cognizable by mind-consciousness with the contact of which their minds are not taken possession completely, as a result they have unshaken, aroused effort with unconfused mindfulness established; the body composed, not angry and the mind concentrated in one point; seeing immediate results for them, I say they should be diligent in the six doors of mental contact.<BR>

</B><P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in Devadaha, a hamlet of the Sakyas.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the monks from there: &szlig;Monks, it is a rare chance; you have gained the right moment to lead the holy life.</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks I have seen the hell called the six spheres. There, whatever forms seen are only unpleasant, never pleasant, always unwelcome, never welcome, always displeasing never pleasing. Whatever sounds heard, &#57389; re &#57389; scents scented, &#57389; re &#57389; savories tasted, &#57389; re &#57389; touches contacted and ideas cognized are only unpleasant, never pleasant, always unwelcome, never welcome, always displeasing, never pleasing.</P>
<P>&szlig;Monks, it is a rare chance; you have gained the right moment to lead the holy life.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Monks I have seen the heaven called the six spheres. There, whatever forms seen are only pleasant never unpleasant, always welcome never unwelcome, always pleasing never displeasing.

</B><P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in Devadaha, a hamlet of the Sakyas.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the monks from there: &szlig;Monks, gods and men rejoice seeing forms, when forms change, lose interest and cease, gods and men abide unpleasantly. Monks, gods and men rejoice hearing sounds, &#57389; re &#57389; scenting scents, &#57389; re &#57389; tasting savories &#57389; re &#57389; cognizing touches and cognizing ideas. When ideas change, lose interest and cease, gods and men abide unpleasantly.</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks, the Thus Gone One worthy and rightfully enlightened knowing, as it really is, the arising, fading, satisfaction, danger and the escape from forms, does not delight in, get attached to and take pleasure in forms. Monks, when forms change, lose interest and cease the Thus Gone One abides pleasantly. Monks, the Thus Gone One worthy and rightfully enlightened knowing, as it really is, the arising, fading, satisfaction, danger and the escape from sounds &#57389; re &#57389; scents &#57389; re &#57389; savories &#57389; re &#57389; touches and ideas does not delight in, get attached to and take pleasure in ideas. Monks, when ideas change, lose interest and cease the Thus Gone One abides pleasantly.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. The Teacher further said:</P><DIR>

<P>&szlig;Forms, sounds, scents, savories, touches and ideas <BR>
Are agreeable and welcomed, when as desired. 1</P>
<P>Gods and humans agree that they are pleasant,<BR>
When they cease it is considered unpleasant 2</P>
<P>Noble ones see the cessation of the self, as pleasant<BR>
It's different from the view of the worldling. 3</P>
<P>Pleasant things are unpleasant to the noble ones<BR>
Unpleasant things are pleasant to the noble ones 4</P>
<P>The foolish are confused and ignorant,<BR>
And do not understand the Teaching 5</P>
<P>To the mindful and clever the Teaching,<BR>
Is clear as though seeing a light. 6.</P>
<P>By those going with the stream `to be',<BR>
And in the domains of Death,<BR>
It is difficult to understand the Teaching 7</P>
<P>All do not understand enlightenment,<BR>
The extinguishing, without desires. 8</P></DIR>

<P>5. &szlig;Monks, gods and men rejoice seeing forms, when forms change, lose interest and cease, gods and men abide unpleasantly. Monks, gods and men rejoice hearing sounds &#57389; re &#57389; scenting scents &#57389; re &#57389; tasting savories &#57389; re &#57389; cognizing touches and cognizing ideas. When ideas change, lose interest and cease, gods and men abide unpleasantly.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Monks, the Thus Gone One worthy and rightfully enlightened knowing, as it really is the arising, fading, satisfaction, danger and the escape from forms, does not delight in, get attached to and take pleasure in forms. Monks, when forms change, lose interest and cease the Thus Gone One abides pleasantly.
