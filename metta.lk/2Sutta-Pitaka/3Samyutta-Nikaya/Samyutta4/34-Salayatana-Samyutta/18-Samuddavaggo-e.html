(228) Samuddo 1 &Yacute; Ocean 1</P>
</B><P>1. &szlig;Monks, the not-learned ordinary man says `It's the ocean.' To monks in the noble ones' discipline it is not the ocean; it is a great expanse of water in movement. Monks, to an untrained man the eye is the ocean which has a speed for forms. He that overcomes the speed for forms together with its waves, whirls, seizures, and demons crosses over the ocean of the eye and stands on hard ground. He is said to be a Brahmin.&ucirc;</P>
<P>2&Yacute;5. Repeat for ear/sounds, nose/odours, tongue/tastes, body/tangibles, and mind/ideas.</P>

Together with its seizures, demons and waves<BR>
Knows and has come to the end the holy life<BR>
Has crossed over, it is said.&ucirc;<BR>

<P>2&Yacute;4. Monks, there are pleasing, agreeable welcomed forms cognizable by eye-consciousness that arouse sensual desires and attachment Monks, in the discipline of the noble ones this is the ocean, in which the world, together with its gods and men, Maras, Brahmas and the community of recluses and Brahmins are for ever immersed, tied together, covered with swellings and blight and woven like overgrown grass and go to decrease and loss without turning from the round of existences."</P>
<P>2&Yacute;5. Repeat for ear/sounds, nose/odours, tongue/tastes, body/tangibles, and mind/ideas.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Monks, if someone's greed, hate and ignorance fades, he crosses over this ocean difficult to cross with its seizures, demons and fearful waves.</P><DIR>

<P>2&Yacute;6. &szlig;Monks, to who ever monk or female monk if there be greed, hate and delusion that is not dispelled for forms cognizable by eye-consciousness and if even a limited form comes to the purview of the eye, it undoubtedly would overwhelm the mind and it would be worse if a limitless form comes to the purview. What is the reason? It's because greed, hate and delusion are not dispelled.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Repeat for sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness, scents cognizable by nose-consciousness, tastes cognizable by tongue-consciousness, touches cognizable by body-consciousness.</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Monks, to who ever monk or female monk if there be greed, hate and delusion that is not dispelled for ideas cognizable by mind-consciousness and if even a limited idea comes to the purview of the mind, it would undoubtedly overwhelm the mind and it would be worse if an unlimited idea comes to the purview. What is the reason? It's because greed, hate and delusion are not dispelled</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Monks, a man with a sharp axe cuts a young tree of the Asatu or Banyan kind, full of sap, would sap ooze from it?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, it would venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;What is the reason?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;It so happens because there is sap in that tree.&ucirc;</P>
<P>9. &szlig;In the same manner monks, to who ever monk or female monk if there be greed, hate and delusion that is not dispelled for forms cognizable by eye-consciousness and even if a limited form comes to the purview of the eye, it would undoubtedly overwhelm the mind and it would be worse if an unlimited form comes to the purview.

<P>13&Yacute;15. &szlig;Monks, to who ever monk or female monk if there be no greed, hate and delusion that is not dispelled for tastes cognizable by tongue-consciousness &#57389; re &#57389; for ideas cognizable by mind-consciousness, if even an unlimited idea comes to the purview of the mind, it would not overwhelm the mind and if a limited idea comes to the purview it would not matter to him. What is the reason? It's because greed, hate and delusion are dispelled</P>
<P>16. &szlig;Monks, a man with a sharp axe cuts an Asatu or Banyan tree that is sapless and dried up, would sap ooze from it?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, it would not, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;What is the reason?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;It so happens because that tree is sapless.&ucirc;</P>

<P>3. Sitting on a side venerable Ud&agrave;y&atilde; said to venerable &acirc;nanda: &szlig;Friend, &acirc;nanda, the Blessed One in various ways has made it clear and declared that this body lacks self, in the same way is it possible to point out, make plain, establish and declare that this consciousness too lacks self?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Friend, Ud&agrave;y&atilde;, in the very way, the Blessed One has made clear, pointed out and made threadbare and declared that this body lacks self, it's possible to point out, make plain, establish and declare that this consciousness too lacks self.</P>
<P>4&Yacute; 6. &szlig;Friend, Ud&agrave;y&atilde;, does eye-consciousness arise on account of the eye and forms?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, it does friend.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Friend, on account of whatever causes and reasons, eye-consciousness arose, those causes and reasons altogether cease, for all circumstances without anything remaining, when that is so, could eye-consciousness be pointed out?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, friend, it could not be pointed out.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Friend, in this way, the Blessed One has made clear, pointed out and made threadbare and declared that this consciousness lacks self.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Repeat for ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness.</P>

<P>&szlig;Yes, it does friend.&ucirc;</P>

<P>10. &szlig;Like a man in search of heartwood, entering the forest with a sharp axe and going in search of heartwood sees a huge, young, straight plantain trunk. He cuts its root and the top and pulls out the sheaves, there he does not come to the sap, how could he find heartwood?</P>
<P>11. &szlig;In the same manner friend, the monk not seeing the self or the belongings of a self in the six spheres of mental contact does not seize anything in the world, not seizing is not worried, not worried is by his self extinguished. He knows birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, duties are done, there is nothing more I wish.&ucirc;<BR>

(235) &acirc;dittena &Yacute; Blazing</P>
</B><P>1. &szlig;Monks, I will teach the sermon on blazing, listen to it. Monks, what is the sermon on blazing?</P>
<P>2. &szlig;Monks, it is noble to destroy the mental faculty of the eye with a burning, blazing, iron spike, so that the details of forms cognizable by eye-consciousness would not be observed and consciousness would not tarry there, with the details. For such a one, dying that very moment, has either one of these two courses of action, hell or animal birth.</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks, seeing this danger, I say it is noble to destroy the mental faculty of the ear with a burning, blazing iron spike, so that the details of sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness would not be observed and consciousness would not tarry there, with the details. For such a one dying that very moment, has either one of these two courses of action, hell or animal birth.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Monks, seeing this danger, I say it is noble to destroy the mental faculty of the nose with a burning, blazing nail cutter, so that the details of scents cognizable by nose-consciousness would not be observed and consciousness would not tarry there, with the details. For such a one dying that very moment, has either one of these two courses of action, hell or animal birth</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Monks, seeing this danger, I say it is noble to destroy the mental faculty of the tongue with a burning, blazing razor, so that the details of tastes cognizable by tongue-consciousness would not be observed and consciousness would not tarry there, with the details. For, such a one dying that very moment, has either one of these two courses of action, hell or animal birth.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Monks, seeing this danger, I say it is noble to touch the mental faculty of the body with a burning, blazing weapon, so that the details of touch, cognizable by body-consciousness would not be observed and consciousness would not tarry there with the details. For, such a one dying that very moment has either one of these two courses of action, hell or animal birth.</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Monks, seeing this danger, I say it is noble to fade from the mental faculty of the mind, I call it the destruction of life, the uselessness of life, the bewilderment of the mind so that there would not be thoughts and thought processes that lead to a split in the Community. Seeing this danger of the barrenness of life, I say this.</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Put aside the burning, blazing iron spike taken to destroy the mental faculty of the eye. Now I reflect, this eye is impermanent, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact and whatever feelings pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of eye-contact these too are impermanent.</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Put a side the burning, blazing iron spike taken to destroy the mental faculty of the ear. Now I reflect, this ear is impermanent, sounds, ear-consciousness, ear-contact and whatever feelings pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of ear-contact these too are impermanent.</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Put aside the burning, blazing nail-cutter taken to destroy the mental faculty of the nose. Now I reflect, this nose is impermanent, scents, nose-consciousness, nose-contact and whatever feelings pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of nose-contact these too are impermanent.</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Put aside the burning, blazing razor taken to destroy the mental faculty of the tongue. Now I reflect this tongue is impermanent, savories, tongue-consciousness, tongue-contact and whatever feelings pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of tongue-contact these too are impermanent</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Put aside the burning, blazing weapon taken to destroy the mental faculty of the body. Now I reflect, this body is impermanent, touches, body-consciousness, body-contact and whatever feelings pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of body-contact these too are impermanent</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Leave alone the mental fading. Now I reflect this mind is impermanent, ideas, mind-consciousness, mind-contact and whatever feelings pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of mind-contact these too are impermanent</P>
<P>14. &szlig;Monks, the learned noble disciple, seeing this turns from the eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and from whatever feelings pleasant, unpleasant, neither unpleasant nor pleasant born from eye-contact. Turning loses interest and is released. Released he knows, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, duties are done and I have no more wishes.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Repeat for the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.</P>
<P>15. &szlig;Monks, this is the sermon of the blaze.&ucirc;<BR>
