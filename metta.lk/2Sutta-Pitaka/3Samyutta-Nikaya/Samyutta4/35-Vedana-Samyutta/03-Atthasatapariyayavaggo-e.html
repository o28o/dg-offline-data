</B><P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha.</P>
<P>2. The wandering ascetic Moliya S&atilde;vaka approached the Blessed One exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side.</P>
<P>3. Sitting on a side, the wandering ascetic Moliya S&atilde;vaka said to the Blessed One: &szlig;Good Gotama, there are some recluses and Brahmins, who hold this view and declare it, `whatever this person feels whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, all that is on account of actions done earlier,' what has good Gotama to say about this?&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;S&atilde;vaka, certain feelings arise on account of bile, one himself knows about the fact that certain feelings arise on account of bile, all the world knows the fact that certain feelings arise on account of bile. S&atilde;vaka, the recluses and Brahmins, who hold this view and declare it, `whatever this person feels whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, all that is on account of actions done earlier, say it ignoring something that they themselves know quite well and they ignore a fact that the whole world accepts, as the truth. Therefore I say this is a wrong view of those recluses and Brahmins.</P>
<P>5. &szlig;S&atilde;vaka, certain feelings arise on account of phlegm, &#57389; re &#57389;</P>
<P>6. &szlig;S&atilde;vaka, certain feelings arise on account of air, &#57389; re &#57389;</P>

<P>8. &szlig;S&atilde;vaka, certain feelings arise on account of the change of seasons, &#57389; re &#57389;</P>
<P>9. &szlig;S&atilde;vaka, certain feelings arise on account of unusual activity, &#57389; re &#57389;</P>
<P>10. &szlig;S&atilde;vaka, certain feelings arise on account of sudden attacks, &#57389; re &#57389;</P>
<P>11. &szlig;S&atilde;vaka, and certain feelings arise on account actions done earlier, one himself knows about the fact that certain feelings arise on account of actions done earlier, all the world knows the fact that certain feelings arise on account of actions done earlier. S&atilde;vaka, the recluses and Brahmins, who hold this view and declare it, `whatever this person feels whether pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant, all that is on account of actions done earlier, say it ignoring something that they themselves know quite well and they ignore a fact that the whole world accepts, as the truth. Therefore I say this is a wrong view of those recluses and Brahmins.&ucirc;</P>
<P>12. When this was said the wandering ascetic S&atilde;vaka said to the Blessed One, &szlig;Good Gotama, now I understand. Think of me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until I live.</P><DIR>

(23) Bhikkhu &Yacute; Monk</P>
</B><P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha.</P>
<P>2. Then a certain monk approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side.</P>
<P>3. Sitting on a side that monk said to the Blessed One: &szlig;Venerable sir, how many are the feelings? How is the arising of feelings? What is the method for the arising of feelings? How is the cessation of feelings? What is the method for the cessation of feelings? What is the satisfaction of feelings? What is the danger of feelings? What is the escape from feelings?</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Monk, pleasant, unpleasant and neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings are the three feelings. Arising of a contact is the arising of feelings. Craving is the path and method for the arising of feelings. Cessation of the contact, is the cessation of feelings and this Noble Eightfold Path such as right view, &#57389; re &#57389; right concentration. is the method for the cessation of feelings, Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of feelings is the satisfaction of feelings. Feelings are impermanent, unpleasant, changing things is the danger of feelings. The taming and dispelling of interest and greed is the escape from feelings.&ucirc;<BR>

<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the monks from there: &szlig;Monks, when I was seeking enlightenment, this occurred to me. `How many are the feelings? What is the arising of feelings?

Craving is the path and method for the arising of feelings. Cessation of the contact, is the cessation of feelings and this Noble Eightfold Path such as right view, &#57389; re &#57389; right concentration is the method for the cessation of feelings. Whatever pleasantness and pleasure arises on account of feelings is the satisfaction of feelings. Feelings are impermanent, unpleasant, changing things is the danger of feelings. The taming and dispelling of interest and greed is the escape from feelings.&ucirc;<BR>
