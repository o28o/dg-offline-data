<P>21. 1. 1. 1.</P>
<P>(1) Nakulapita &Yacute; Nakula Father</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the deer park in the Bhesakala forest among the Su&uuml;sum&agrave;ra rocks.</P>
<P>2. Then the householder Nakula father approached the Blessed One sat on a side and said:</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Venerable sir, I am now decayed, aged, come to the end of my life, forever with an ailing body. I am helped to see impermanence, by the monks who do the development of the mind. Venerable sir, Blessed One, advice me, for my welfare and happiness for a long time.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Householder, your body is ailing, that's right. If anyone maintaining a body should acknowledge that he is without ailments even for a moment, it is nothing but foolishness. Therefore, householder, you should train in this manner: `My body ails, my mind will be without ailments.' Thus should be the training.&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. Then the householder Nakula delighted and accepted the words of the Blessed One, got up from his seat, worshipped, circumambulated the Blessed One, and approached venerable S&agrave;riputta, worshipped him, and sat on a side.</P>
<P>6. To the seated householder Nakula, venerable S&agrave;riputta said: &szlig;Householder, your face is very pleasant, your mental faculties seem clear, and the complexion of your face is pure. Did you hear a sermon from the Blessed One?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, why isn't it so? The Blessed One has just spoken to me and I am sprinkled with deathlessness.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Householder, in which manner did the Blessed One speak to you and how were you sprinkled with deathlessness?&ucirc;</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Venerable sir, I approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side and said:</P>
<P>&szlig;`Venerable sir, I am now decayed, aged, come to the end of life, my body is ailing, I am helped to see impermanence by the monks who do the development of the mind. Venerable sir, Blessed One, advise me, for my welfare and happiness for a long time'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Then the Blessed One said to me: `Householder, your body is ailing, that's right. If anyone maintaining a body, should acknowledge that he is without ailments even for a moment, it is nothing but foolishness. Therefore householder you should train in this manner, my body is ailing, my mind will be without ailments. Thus should be the training.'</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, in this manner I was advised and sprinkled with deathlessness.&ucirc;</P>
<P>8. &szlig;`Householder, did you not cross question the Blessed One on this, asking: `Venerable sir what is an ailing body and an ailing mind? What is an ailing body and a non ailing mind?'&ucirc;</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Venerable sir, S&agrave;riputta, we came from afar to know the meaning of this, it is good that the meaning occurs to venerable S&agrave;riputta.&ucirc;</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Then, householder, listen and attend carefully.&ucirc;</P>
<P>The householder Nakula father said &szlig;Yes venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>11. Venerable S&agrave;riputta said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Householder, what is an ailing body and an ailing mind?</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Here householder, the ordinary man who has not seen noble ones or Great Beings or heard their Teaching and not clever in their Teaching, reflects matter from self </FONT><A HREF="#Note01">[1]</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> or a material self or in self matter or in matter self. Or his mind is rooted in a preposition `I am matter, it's my matter' that matter changes on account of that change arise grief, lamentation, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress.</P>
<P>13. &szlig;He reflects feelings from self or a feeling self or in self feelings or in feelings self. Or his mind is rooted in a preposition `I am feelings, they are my feelings'. Those feelings change and on account of that change arise grief, lamentation, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress.</P>

<P>15. &szlig;He reflects intentions from self, or an intending self, or in self intentions, or in intentions self. Or his mind is rooted in a preposition `I am intentions, they are mine.' Those intentions change and on account of that change arise grief, lamentation, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress.</P>
<P>16. &szlig;He reflects consciousness from self, or a conscious self, or in self consciousness, or in consciousness self. Or his mind is rooted in a preposition `I am consciousness, it's mine.' That consciousness changes and on account of that change arise grief, lamentation, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress.</P>
<P>17. &szlig;Householder, this is the ailing body and the ailing mind.</P>
<P>18. &szlig;Householder, what is an ailing body and a non-ailing mind?</P>
<P>19. &szlig;Here, householder, the learned noble disciple who has seen noble ones and Great Beings, heard their Teaching, and is clever in that Teaching, does not reflect matter from self, or a material self, or in self matter, or in matter self and his mind is not rooted in a preposition, `I am matter, it's mine.' That matter changes and on account of that change grief, lamentation, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress do not arise.</P>
<P>20. &szlig;He does not reflect feelings from self, or a feeling self, or in self feelings, or in feelings self, and his mind is not rooted in a preposition `I am feelings, they are mine' those feelings change. On account of that change, grief, lamentation, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress do not arise.</P>
<P>21. &szlig;He does not reflect perceptions from self, or a perceiving self, or in self perceptions, or in perceptions self and his mind is not rooted in a preposition `I am perceptions, they are mine'. Those perceptions change and on account of that change grief, lamentation, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress do not arise.</P>
<P>22. &szlig;He does not reflect intentions from self, or an intending self or in self intentions or in intentions self and his mind is not rooted in a preposition `I am intentions, they are mine'. Those intentions change and on account of that change grief, lamentation, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress do not arise.</P>
<P>23. &szlig;He does not reflect consciousness from self, or a conscious self, or in self consciousness, or in consciousness self and his mind is not rooted in a preposition `I am consciousness, it's mine'. That consciousness changes and on account of that change grief, lamentation, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress do not arise.</P>
<P>24. &szlig;Householder, this is the ailing body and the non ailing mind.&ucirc;</P>
<P>25. Venerable S&agrave;riputta said thus and the householder Nakula father delighted in the words of venerable S&agrave;riputta.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>21. 1. 1. 2.</P>
<P>(2) Devadaha &Yacute; At Devadaha</P>
<P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living with the Sakyas in a hamlet called Devadaha.</P>
<P>2. Then many monks who wanted to go to the western states approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on a side.</P>
<P>3. Seated on a side those monks said to the Blessed One: &szlig;Venerable sir, we wish to go to the western states and make dwellings there.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Monks did you speak about this with S&agrave;riputta?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, we did not speak about this with venerable S&agrave;riputta.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Monks, speak with S&agrave;riputta. He is wise and helpful to the co-associates in the holy life.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Those monks replied, &szlig;Yes, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. At that time venerable S&agrave;riputta was seated in a certain ringworm shrub not far away from the Blessed One.</P>
<P>5. Then those monks delighted and agreed with the Blessed One, got up from their seats worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One and approached venerable S&agrave;riputta, exchanged friendly conversation and sat on a side.</P>
<P>6. The seated monks said thus to venerable S&agrave;riputta:</P>
<P>&szlig;Friend, S&agrave;riputta, we wish to go to the western states and make dwellings there, we have spoken to the Teacher about this.&ucirc;</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Friends, in various kingdoms there are monks, who are wise warriors, wise brahmins, wise householders and also wise recluses. Monks, humans are wise and are of the nature of searching, what the view of the teacher is and what he teaches. How much of the Teaching has the venerable ones heard, absorbed, wisely penetrated and explaining would tell what the Blessed One had said and would explain in accordance with the Teaching without making any blames.&ucirc;</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Friend, S&agrave;riputta, we came from afar to know the meaning of these words from venerable S&agrave;riputta. Good, if venerable S&agrave;riputta explains the meaning of these words to us.&ucirc;</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Then friends, listen and attend carefully, I will tell.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Those monks replied &szlig;Yes friend we will and venerable S&agrave;riputta said thus:</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Friends, in various kingdoms there are monks, who are wise warriors, wise brahmins, wise householders and also wise recluses who are of the nature of searching, if asked, `What is the view of your teacher and what does he teach?' It should be, `The Teacher tells us to tame interest and greed.'</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Friends, when explained thus too there is a possibility the wise warriors, brahmins and recluses would ask a further question, `To tame interest and greed for what, does the venerable ones' Teacher instruct? Friends, the Teacher instructs us to tame interest and greed for matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions, and for consciousness.</P>
<P>12. Friends, when explained thus too there is a possibility that the wise warriors, or brahmins could be searching and would ask a further question, seeing what danger does the venerable ones' Teacher instruct? To tame interest and greed for matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions and consciousness?' Friends, when asked thus you should explain thus. `Friends, when interest and greed, love, thirst, lament, and craving for matter is not dispelled, when that matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions and consciousness change, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress arise; and when interest, greed, love, thirst, lament and craving for feelings, perceptions, intentions, and consciousness are dispelled, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress do not arise. Friends, seeing this danger our Teacher has declared to tame interest and greed for matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions and consciousness.'</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Friends, when explained thus too there is a possibility, for the wise warriors, brahmins, and recluses to ask a further question, &szlig;Seeing what benefit does the venerable ones' Teacher instruct? To tame interest and greed for matter?' Friends, when asked thus you should explain thus. `Friends, when interest and greed, love, thirst, lament and craving for matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions, and consciousness are dispelled, when that matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions, and consciousness change, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure, and distress do not arise. Friends, seeing this benefit our Teacher has declared to tame interest and greed for matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions and consciousness.'</P>
<P>14. &szlig;Friends if leading a life with demerit here and now is pleasant, without trouble, without worry, and lament and also after death a good birth could be desired, the Blessed One would not have declared the dispelling of demerit in this life.</P>
<P>15. &szlig;Since, friends, someone leading a life of demerit is here and now unpleasant, with trouble, with worry, with lament and also after death could desire an evil state, the Blessed One has declared the dispelling of demerit in this life.</P>
<P>16. &szlig;Friends if leading a life of merit here and now is unpleasant, with trouble, with worry, with lament and also after death an evil birth could be desired, the Blessed One would not have declared the accumulation of merit in this life.</P>
<P>17. &szlig;Since, friends, someone leading a life of merit is here and now pleasant, without trouble, without worry and lament and also after death could desire a good birth the Blessed One has declared the accumulation of merit in this life.&ucirc;</P>
<P>18. Venerable S&agrave;riputta said thus and those monks delighted in the words of venerable S&agrave;riputta.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>21. 1. 1. 3.</P>
<P>(3) H&agrave;liddak&agrave;ni I &Yacute; The Householder H&agrave;lidd&agrave;kani I</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na was living in a house where there was a tree in which hawks lived.</P>
<P>2. Then the householder H&agrave;liddak&agrave;ni approached venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na worshipped and sat on a side.</P>
<P>3. Sitting the householder H&agrave;liddak&agrave;ni said thus to venerable Mah&agrave;kacc&agrave;na: &szlig;Venrable sir, answering Magandiya's question in the A&ntilde;&ntilde;haka Vagga the Blessed One had said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>`Leaving the household he goes homeless,<BR>
Does not make any associations in the village<BR>
Free from sensuality does not desire them.<BR>
How is it, he has no disputes with people.'</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, of this short exposition of the Blessed One how should we know the detailed meaning?&ucirc;</P>
<P>4-7. &szlig;Householder, the material element is the habitation of consciousness and the greedy bond with the material element is the behavior of consciousness in that habitation. Householder, the feeling element is the habitation of consciousness and the greedy bond with the feeling element is the behavior of consciousness in that habitation. Householder, the perceiving element is the habitation of consciousness and the greedy bond with the perceiving element is the behavior of consciousness in that habitation. Householder, the intending element is the habitation of consciousness and the greedy bond with the intending element is the behavior of consciousness in that habitation.</P>
<P>&szlig;Householder, these are the sheltered behaviors of consciousness.</P>
<P>8. Householder what is the lack of shelter for behavior?</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Householder, the Thus Gone One has dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made a palm stump, and made not to grow again whatever interest, greed, liking, craving and the latent tendency to settle in the material element. Therefore it is said, `The Thus Gone One has no shelter for behaviors.'</P>
<P>10. &szlig;The Thus Gone One has dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made a palm stump, and made not to grow again the interest, greed, liking and the craving for the latent tendency to settle in the feeling element. Therefore, it is said `The Thus Gone One has no shelter for behaviors.'</P>

<P>13. &szlig;The Thus Gone One has dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made a palm stump, and made not to grow again the interest, greed, liking and the craving for the latent tendency to settle in the conscious element.

<P>14. &szlig;Householder, in this manner there is no shelter for behaviors.</P>
<P>15. &szlig;Householder, what is the behavior in a settlement?</P>

Therefore, the Thus Gone has no behavior in settlements.</P>
<P>17. &szlig;Householder, this is non-behavior in settlements.</P>
<P>18. &szlig;Householder, how is there associations with the village?</P>
<P>`&szlig;Here, householder, a certain one associates the village with interest, grieving with the grief stricken, happy with the happy and unhappy with the unhappy. When there are some duties to be done, he yokes himself to do those duties. Householder, in this manner there is association in the village</P>
<P>19. &szlig;Householder, how is there no associations with the village?</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, householder, the monk does not associate the village with interest. He does not grieve with the grief stricken, is not happy with the happy and not unhappy with the unhappy. When there are some duties to be done, he does not yoke himself to do those duties. Householder, in this manner there are no associations in the village.</P>
<P>20. &szlig;Householder, how is there no freedom from sensuality?</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, householder, a certain one is not free from greed, interest, love, thirst, lament and craving for sensual desires. Thus householder, he is not free from sensuality.</P>
<P>21. &szlig;Householder, how is there freedom from sensuality?</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, householder, a certain one is free from greed, interest, love, thirst, lament and craving for sensual desires. Thus householder, he is free from sensuality.</P>
<P>22. &szlig;Householder, how is there longing for the future?</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, householder, it occurs to a certain one, I should be of this matter in the future, of these feelings in the future, of these perceptions, of these intentions in the future, of this consciousness in the future. Householder, this is longing the future.</P>

<P>24. &szlig;Householder, how is there a dispute with the people?</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, householder, a certain one disputes. `You do not know this Discipline. I know the Discipline. What do you know of this Discipline? You have fallen to the wrong method. I have fallen to the right method. What have to be told first, you tell later. What has to be told last, you tell first. I talk with reasons, you talk without reason.

<P>`Leaving the household he goes homeless,<BR>
Does not make any associations in the village<BR>
Free from sensuality does not desire them.<BR>
How is it, he has no disputes with people.'</P></DIR>
