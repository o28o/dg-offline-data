<P>(22) Bhar&agrave;&uuml; &Yacute; The Load</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. From there the Blessed One addressed the monks:</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks, I will preach you the burden, the carrier of the burden, taking up the burden and putting off the burden. Listen to it carefully with attention.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Monks what is the burden?</P>
<P>The five holding masses is the reply. What five? The holding mass of matter, the holding mass of feelings, the holding mass of perceptions, the holding mass of intentions and the holding mass of consciousness. Monks, to this is called the burden.</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Monks, who is the bearer of the burden? The reply is this person, such as the venerable one of this name and clan. Monks, to him is said, the bearer of the burden.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Monks, what is taking up the load?</P>
<P>&szlig;It is this craving to be, again and again, enjoying this and that with interest and greed, such as greed for sensuality, greed `to be' and greed, `not to be'. Monks, to this is called taking up the load.</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Monks, what is putting off the burden? The cessation of that same greed without anything remaining, the abandoning, rejection, the release and doing without it. Monks, to this is called putting off the burden.&ucirc;</P>
<P>8. The Blessed One said thus and further the Teacher said thus:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&szlig;Indeed the burden is the five holding masses<BR>
The bearer of the burden is this person<BR>
Taking up a burden is unpleasant.<BR>
And putting off the burden is pleasant<BR>
Laying down the heavy load,<BR>
And not taking up another load,<BR>
Pulling out craving altogether<BR>
And satisfied, he is finally extinguished&ucirc;</P>

<P>(26) Ass&agrave;do I &Yacute; Satisfaction I</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. From there the Blessed One addressed the monks:</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks, in the past when I was an aspirant for enlightenment this occurred to me:</P>
<P>4. &szlig;What is the satisfaction in matter, what is the danger in matter and what is the escape from matter? What is the satisfaction in feelings, what is the danger in feelings and what is the escape from feelings? What is the satisfaction in perceptions, what is the danger in perceptions and what is the escape from perceptions? What is the satisfaction in intentions, what is the danger in intentions and what is the escape from intentions? What is the satisfaction in consciousness, what is the danger in consciousness and what is the escape from consciousness?</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Monks, it occurred to me:</P>
<P>6. &szlig;The pleasantness and pleasure that arises on account of matter is the satisfaction. That matter is impermanent, unpleasant and subject to change is the danger. The taming of interest and greed for matter and dispelling interest and greed for it, is the escape from matter.</P>
<P>7. &szlig;The pleasantness and pleasure that arises on account of feelings is the satisfaction. The fact that feelings are impermanent, unpleasant and subject to change is the danger. The taming of interest and greed for feelings and dispelling interest and greed for them is the escape from feelings.</P>
<P>8. &szlig;The pleasantness and pleasure that arises on account of perceptions is the satisfaction. The fact that perceptions are impermanent, unpleasant and subject to change is the danger. The taming of interest and greed for perceptions and dispelling interest and greed for them is the escape from perceptions.</P>
<P>9. &szlig;The pleasantness and pleasure that arises on account of intentions is the satisfaction. The fact that intentions are impermanent, unpleasant and subject to change is the danger. The taming of interest and greed for intentions and the dispelling of interest and greed for them, is the escape from intentions.</P>
<P>10. The pleasantness and pleasure that arises on account of consciousness is the satisfaction. That consciousness is impermanent, unpleasant and subject to change is its danger. The taming of interest and greed for consciousness and dispelling interest and greed for it, is the escape from consciousness.</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Monks, until I accurately knew the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape from the five holding masses as it really is, I did not acknowledge the attainment of rightful noble enlightenment, to this world together with its gods and men, Maras, Brahmas and the community of recluses and brahmins.</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Monks, when I accurately knew the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape from the five holding masses as it really is, I acknowledged the attainment of rightful noble enlightenment, to this world together with its gods and men, Maras, Brahmas, and the community of recluses and brahmins.</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Knowledge too arose to me about this and the release of my mind became unshakeable. This is my last birth. I will not be born again.&ucirc;</P>

<P>17. &szlig;Monks, I wandered in search of the escape from consciousness, I have wisely seen and realized all the escapes from consciousness.</P>
<P>18. &szlig;Monks, until I accurately knew the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape from the five holding masses as it really is, I did not acknowledge the attainment of rightful noble enlightenment, to this world together with its gods and men, Maras, Brahmas and the community of recluses and brahmins</P>
<P>19. &szlig;Monks, when I accurately knew the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape from the five holding masses as it really is, I acknowledged the attainment of rightful noble enlightenment, to this world together with its gods and men, Maras, Brahmas and the community of recluses and brahmins</P>
<P>20. Knowledge, too, arose to me about this, and the release of my mind became unshakeable. `This is my last birth. I will not be born again.'&ucirc;</P>

<P>19. &szlig;Monks, when they accurately know the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape from the five holding masses as it really is, they will live with a mind freed, unbound, unrestrictedly released and set free from this world together with its gods and men, Maras, Brahmas and the community of recluses and brahmins.&ucirc;</P>
