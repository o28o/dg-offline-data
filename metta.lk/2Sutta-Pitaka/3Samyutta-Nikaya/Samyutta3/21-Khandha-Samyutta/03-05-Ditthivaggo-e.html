<P>(149) Ajjhattika&uuml; &Yacute; Seizing Pleasant And Unpleasant Feelings</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. The Blessed One addressed the monks from there:</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks, when what is present and grasping what, do pleasant and unpleasant feelings rise to someone?&ucirc;</P>
<P>4 &szlig;Venerable sir, the Blessed One is the leader for the Teaching, hearing it from the Blessed One the monks will bear it in mind.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Then monks, listen carefully, I will tell you.</P>
<P>5. &szlig;When mindful of matter, seizing it, pleasant and unpleasant feelings arise to someone.</P>
<P>6-8. &szlig;When mindful of feelings, perceptions, and intentions, seizing them, pleasant and unpleasant feelings arise to someone.</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Aware of it and seizing consciousness, pleasant and unpleasant feelings arise to someone.</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Monks, is matter permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is impermanent.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is unpleasant.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That which is impermanent, unpleasant, changing, is it suitable to be reflected, `It is mine, I am that, it is my self'?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That is not so, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Are feelings, perceptions, and intentions permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, they are impermanent.&ucirc;</P>

<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, they are unpleasant.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Those which are impermanent, unpleasant, changing are they suitable to be reflected, `They are mine, I am there and they are my self'?&ucirc;'</P>

<P>&szlig;That is not so, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>15. &szlig;Monks, the learned noble disciple, seeing it thus, turns from matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions, and consciousness. Turning, looses interest and is released. Released, he knows, `I am released, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, duties are done, and I have nothing more to wish'.&ucirc;</P>

<P>&szlig;That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is unpleasant.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That which is impermanent, unpleasant and a changing thing, is it suitable to be reflected, it is mine, I am that and it is my self?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That is not so, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Are feelings, perceptions, and intentions permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, they are impermanent.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Those which are impermanent, are they unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, they are unpleasant.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Those which are impermanent, unpleasant, changing are they suitable to be reflected, `They are mine, I am there they are my self?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That is not so, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>14. &szlig;Monks, is consciousness permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is impermanent.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is unpleasant.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That which is impermanent, unpleasant and a changing thing, is it suitable to be reflected, `It is mine, I am that, it is my self'?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That is not so, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>15. &szlig;Monks, the learned noble disciple, seeing this, turns from matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions, and consciousness. Turning, looses interest and is released. Released, he knows, `I am released, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, duties are done, and I have nothing more to wish'.&ucirc;</P>

<P>(158) &acirc;nandena &Yacute; By Venerable &acirc;nanda</P>
<P>1. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. Then venerable &acirc;nanda approached the Blessed One worshipped, sat on a side and said:</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Good if the Blessed One would teach me in short, so that I could abide secluded and diligent to dispel.&ucirc;</P>
<P>4. &szlig;&acirc;nanda, is matter permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is impermanent.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is unpleasant.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That impermanent, unpleasant, changing thing&THORN;is it suitable to be considered, `it is mine, I am that, and it is my self'?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is not suitable.&ucirc;</P>
<P>5-8. &szlig;&acirc;nanda, are feelings, perceptions, intentions, and consciousness permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, they are impermanent.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Those that are impermanent, are they unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, they are unpleasant.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Those impermanent, unpleasant, changing things are they suitable to be considered, `They are mine, I am those, and they are my self&ucirc;?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, they are not suitable.&ucirc;</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Therefore &acirc;nanda, whatever matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions, and consciousness in the past, future or at present, seized or not, rough or fine, unexalted or exalted, far or near, are not mine, I am not those and they are not my self.</P>
<P>14. &szlig;&acirc;nanda, the learned noble disciple seeing it thus, turns from matter, feelings, perceptions, intentions, and consciousness. Turning, looses interest. Without interest he is released and knows, &szlig;I am released, the holy life is lived to the end, duties are done, I have nothing more to wish'.&ucirc;</P>
