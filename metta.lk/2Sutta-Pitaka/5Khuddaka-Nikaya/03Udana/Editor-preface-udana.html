<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times_CSX+,Times New Roman">The text
of
Ud&agrave;nap&agrave;&euml;i presented here is
substantially a transliteration of the Sinhala version of the text as
printed in the Buddha Jayanti Tripitaka Series, Volume XXIV. In
preparing this edition the corrigenda (&divide;uddhi patraya) as
printed on page xxvi of that volume have been taken into account. Other
corrections, made by the present editor while preparing this edition of
the text, have been noted in the appropriate place.</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times_CSX+,Times New Roman">In the
original
edition there were many cases where BJT was inconsistent in its use of
punctuation, layout, and entering of notes. Here an attempt has been
made to present a more standardized version of the text in this regard,
but as the matter is trivial on the one hand, and extremely numerous on
the other, these sort of changes have not been noted.</font></b></p>
<dir>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times_CSX+,Times New Roman">For this
edition
the abbreviations in BJT have been interpreted as follows:</font></b></p>
<dir>
<p><b><font face="Times_CSX+,Times New Roman">S&atilde; =
Palm leaf book<br>
Mu = Printed book<br>
Mudditap&agrave;&euml;&atilde; = Printed edition of the text<br>
Muddita&ntilde;&ntilde;hakath&agrave; = Printed edition of
the commentary<br>
A&ntilde;&ntilde;hakath&agrave; = Commentary<br>
Machasa = ChS (i.e. the Burmese Cha&ntilde;&ntilde;ha
Sa&iuml;g&agrave;yana edition)<br>
Sy&agrave; = Thai (i.e. the Royal Thai edition)<br>
Sa&otilde;g&atilde;tik&agrave;rakather&agrave;na&uuml;
g&agrave;thayo = Verses recited by the elders at the 1st council<br>
Kesuci potthakesu = In some books<br>
Katthaci = Seen somewhere<br>
Sabbattha = Everywhere else<br>
Iti pi p&agrave;&ntilde;ho = Is another reading<br>
P&agrave; = Reading noted in the commentary</font></b></p>
</dir>
</dir>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times_CSX+,Times New Roman">As can be
seen a
number of the abbreviations are rather vague, no indication is given as
to which palm leaf books have been consulted, for instance, or exactly
which edition of the commentary (though here we may assume it to be the
Simon Hewavitarne Bequest Series edition). </font></b></p>
<p><b><font face="Times_CSX+,Times New Roman">Two versions of the
text have been prepared here. The first (P&agrave;&euml;i 1)
presents the text by itself; in the second (P&agrave;&euml;i 2)
the metrical markings have been put in above the verses, and there is a
short commentary on the metre for those who are interested in such
matters, and as a guide for editors who may wish to establish a better
version of the text later on. The metre and variations are normally
noted alongside the verse, but the normal form of the Vatta metre,
being so numerous, has to be presumed when no further identification
has been provided. </font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><b><font face="Times_CSX+,Times New Roman">There are
two
complete word indexes to the text, one giving the BJT page number, and
the other the sutta number; there is also an index to the first lines
of the g&agrave;th&agrave;s. Note that there are also two
versions of these indexes - those to P&agrave;&euml;i 1 lead to
that version of the text; those to P&agrave;&euml;i 2 to the
other. An index to the metres have also been compiled.</font></b></p>
