<B><P>4. Kas&atilde;bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja Sutta- The farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja.</P>
</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>Once the Blessed One lived in the brahmin village Ekan&agrave;liya in Magadha, among the southern&nbsp;hills. On a certain day about five hundred people were ploughing the fields of the farmer&nbsp;Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja. Then the Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes&nbsp;approached the work place of the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja. The farmer at that time was distributing food&nbsp;and the Blessed One approached the place where food was distributed and stood there for alms.&nbsp;The brahmin seeing the Blessed One standing for alms said:"Recluse, I plough and sow and&nbsp;then partake food, you too plough and sow and partake food. " The Blessed One said:&nbsp;&szlig;Brahmin, I too plough and sow and partake food. " The brahmin said, &szlig; We do not see good Gotama's&nbsp;yoke, plough, plough share, driving stick or buffaloes, yet good Gotama says I plough, sow and&nbsp;then partake food &szlig; Then the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja addressed the Blessed One in verse.</P>
<P>76. &szlig;We know the farmer too well, we do not see him ploughing. ,<BR>
Tell us that ploughing, we like to know your ploughing. "</P>
<P>77. &szlig;Faith is the seed, austerities the rain, wisdom my yoke and plough,<BR>
Conscientiousness the pole, mind the reins, and mindfulness is my driving stick.</P>
<P>78. Restrained in body and words, I know the right amount to partake<BR>
Indeed I do the mowing, and forbearance is my release.</P>
<P>79. Effort is my yoked oxen, to run to the end of the yoke,<BR>
There if you go non-stop, you will not grieve.</P>
<P>80. Ploughing in this manner, results in the fruits of deathlessness,<BR>
Ploughing thus you are released from all unpleasantness.</P>
<P>Then the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja served rich porridge into a huge bronze bowl and offered it to the&nbsp;Blessed One and said. &szlig; good Gotama, partake of the porridge since you plough for deathlessness.</P>
<P>81. &szlig;Look, brahmin, food gained by chanting verses is not suitable for me<BR>
Becoming mindful of the Teaching, enlightened ones preach at the correct moment.</P>
<P>82. Offer those eatables and drinks to some perfected sage who has destroyed desires,<BR>
Has gone beyond doubts, it becomes a field of merit to one expecting merit. "</P>
<P>&szlig;O! Good Gotama, to whom shall I offer this porridge, &szlig; </P>
<P>&szlig;Brahmin, among gods and&nbsp;men, M&agrave;ras, Brahmas, and the community of recluses and brahmins, I do not see anyone who&nbsp;partaking this porridge, could completely digest it, other than a Thus Gone One or the disciple&nbsp;of a Thus Gone One. Therefore throw it to a place where there is no green, or put it into some&nbsp;water where there are no living things. " Then the brahmin Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja threw that porridge&nbsp;into some water where there were no living things. That porridge thrown into the water,&nbsp;made a hissing sound and fumigated, like a ploughshare heated throughout the day put in&nbsp;the water would give a hissing sound and fumigate. Then the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja frightened&nbsp;and with hairs standing on end, approached the Blessed One, and putting his head at the feet of the&nbsp;Blessed One said: &szlig;Good Gotama, now I know! To me it seems that something overturned&nbsp;is now re-installed. Something covered is made visible, One who has lost his way is shown&nbsp;the way. And as though a lamp was lighted for the dark, so that those who have eyes could see&nbsp;forms. Good Gotama, in various ways you have explained the Teaching. Now I take refuge in&nbsp;good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I gain the going forth&nbsp;and the higher ordination in the dispensation of good Gotama. "</P>
<P>Then the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja obtained the going forth and the higher ordination in the dispen-&nbsp;sation of the Blessed One. Soon after the higher ordination venerable Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja secluded&nbsp;and withdrawn from the crowd abode diligently to dispel, and before long , for whatever reason&nbsp;sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and go forth, that highest end of the holy life by&nbsp;himself realising abode. He himself knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end ,&nbsp;there is nothing more to wish for. Venerable Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja became one of the arahants. <SUP>1</P>
</SUP><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9; <B>5. Cunda Sutta- To Cunda.</P>
</B><P>83. Cundakamm&agrave;raputta asked the Blessed One:<BR>
&szlig;I ask the wise enlightened lord of the Teaching, the noble two-footed charioteer free of greed,<BR>
How many recluses are there in the world"</P>
<P>84. The Blessed One said:<BR>
&szlig;Cunda, there are only four, not a fifth, asked, I will explain them with examples,<BR>
Winner of the path, proclaimer of the path, abider on the path and the soiler of the path. "</P>
<P>85. Cundakamm&agrave;raputta asked the Blessed One:<BR>
&szlig;To whom do enlightened ones say winners of the path, how is the proclaimer described,<BR>
Explain the abider on the path, and explain to me the soiler of the path.</P>
<P>86. The Blessed One said:<BR>
&szlig;With doubts dispelled, arrow pulled out and greed dispelled is attached to extinction,<BR>
He is a leader to the world together with the gods. Enlightened Ones say such are<BR>
winners of the path.</P>
<P>87. One knowing the highest as the highest, would preach and explain that same Teaching ,<BR>
That unwavering sage, doubts overcome, is second bhikkhu, the proclaimer of the path.</P>
<P>88. He who lives according to the well preached Teaching, skilfully and mindfully,<BR>
Developing the mental states not blameworthy, is third bhikkhu, the abider on the path.</P>
<P>89. Disguised as a virtuous one the daring highway robber springs,<BR>
The deceitful untrained noisy one, lives disguised, he is soiler of the path.</P>
<P>90. It is hard for the ordinary one to know these, the wise noble disciples, know all of them, as they really are,<BR>
Knowing, they do not place faith in them, how could the wicked impure be compared to the not wicked pure. "</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">6. Par&agrave;bhava Sutta. - The downfall.</P>

Then the Blessed One putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes entered&nbsp;S&agrave;vatthi for alms. At that time in the house of the brahmin Aggikabh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja the fire was&nbsp;lighted to perform the fire sacrifice. The Blessed One going for alms in due order approached the&nbsp;house of the brahmin Aggikabh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja. The brahmin saw the Blessed One approaching&nbsp;from a distance and said thus to the Blessed One. &szlig;You shaveling, you recluse, you outcaste&nbsp;stop there. Then the Blessed One asked: &szlig;O! Brahmin, do you know an outcaste , or the factors&nbsp;that make an outcaste". The brahmin said, &szlig;Good Gotama, I do not know the outcaste or the&nbsp;factors that make an outcaste. It is for my good, if the outcaste and the factors that make an&nbsp;outcaste are taught". &szlig;If so brahmin, listen carefully and pay attention I will tell" and the Blessed&nbsp;One said thus:</P>

And nothing is offered to him, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>131. If one deluded shouts for some trifling matter,<BR>
Without any good reason, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>132. If one praises oneself and disparages others<BR>
Measuring others on account of his conceit, know him as an outcaste.</P>
<P>133. The wrathful, greedy, selfish, crafty, evil desired one<BR>
Without conscience and remorse is as an outcaste. .</P>
<P>134. He that runs down the enlightened one, his disciples<BR>
Those gone forth and householders is an outcaste.</P>
<P>135. He that acknowledges he is perfect, without that attainment,<BR>
Is a robber in this and the Brahm&agrave; world, he is the worst of outcastes.</P>
<P>I declare that these are the outcastes.</P>
<P>136. By birth one does not become an outcaste, or a brahmin.<BR>
By actions one becomes an outcaste, and a brahmin.</P>
<P>137. Know this too according to the example I give,<BR>
How Sop&agrave;ka the son of the outcaste became known as M&agrave;tanga.</P>
<P>138. M&agrave;tanga the rare one became perfect and famous<BR>
And many warriors and brahmins came to wait on him.</P>
<P>139. He ascended the heavenly chariot and rode resplendent on the highway<BR>
Giving up sensuality was born in the world of Brahm&agrave;, birth did not stop him from that.</P>
<P>140. Those born in brahmin families and related to the reciters of the sacred sayings<BR>
Are constantly seen involved in demerit.</P>
<P>141. Here and now debased, hereafter are born in loss<BR>
Birth does not stop them from being debased and going to loss.</P>
<P>142. By birth one does not become an outcaste, or a brahmin.<BR>
By actions one becomes an outcaste and a brahmin".</P>
<P>When this was said, the brahmin Aggikabh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja said thus to the Blessed One: &szlig;Good&nbsp;Gotama, now I know, to me it seems that something overturned is re-installed, something&nbsp;covered is made manifest. It seems as though the path was shown to one who had lost his way.&nbsp;It seems as though an oil lamp was lighted for the darkness, so that those who have eyes could&nbsp;see forms. In various ways good Gotama has explained the Teaching. .&nbsp;Now I take refuge in good Gotama, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May&nbsp;good Gotama think of me as one who has taken refuge from today until life lasts".</P>

<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the domain of the demon Aalavaka. Then the demon Aalavaka&nbsp;approached the Blessed One and said: &szlig;Recluse, go out.

Again the demon said, &szlig;Recluse, enter. "&nbsp;The Blessed One said: &szlig;Alright, friend" and entered. For the fourth time the demon said:&nbsp;&szlig;Recluse, go out" The Blessed One said: &szlig;Friend, I will not go out , do whatever you could&nbsp;do. ".</P>
<P>&szlig;Recluse, I will ask you a question, if you do not explain it, I will confuse your mind, or will split your heart, or will take you by the feet and throw to the other bank of the river. "</P>
<P>&szlig;In this world of gods and men, together with M&agrave;ras, Brahmas, and the community of recluses&nbsp;and brahmins I do not see anyone who could confuse my mind, or split my heart, or taken by the feet&nbsp;could throw me to the other bank of the river. Yet, do ask, whatever you desire to. Then the demon&nbsp;Aalavaka addressed the Blessed One in verse.</P>

Of tastes what is the foremost, and living how is the foremost livelihood. "</P>

Through truthfulness one becomes famous and by giving friends are bound.</P>
<P>188. To a householder with faith, if there be truthfulness, training,<BR>
Right view and generosity, he would not grieve afterwards.</P>
<P>189. Now come on, question other recluses and brahmins, to know,<BR>
Whether there is much truthfulness, training, generosity and forbearance evident here.</P>
<P>190. &szlig;What is there to question now, from recluses and brahmins<BR>
Today I know what is essential for the next birth.</P>
