<P ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE ATTAKA VAGGA </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE SUTTA NIP&acirc;TA</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The attaka vagga consists of sixteen suttas which are specifically mentioned in various other suttas in the Ud&agrave;na etc. This shows their importance as giving the complete Teaching of the Blessed One in a nut-shell. The Ud&agrave;na speaks of bhikkhus who knew all these sixteen suttas by heart together with their meanings. The Blessed One applauds those bhikkhus as they would reap the highest results when they know those suttas. These suttas deal with difficult aspects of the Teaching, such as dependent arising and dependent cessation very clearly and precisely. They are the experiences of name and matter contact, being and non-being, and how fights and disputes arise and how they cease. These practical bits of advice are very important to any buddhist. 'The diffusedness of the world' as I translate it so often, is our involvement in the six spheres of mental contact, as permanent, agreeable and mine, and it is shown as the cause for fights and disputes. Further, arahanta, a buddhist's ideal and aim is clearly depicted. The training could start at any of these points, to become a worthy one; Arahant. . May this small treatise help many beings to end unpleasantness-dukkha </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>766. When sensual desires are satisfied,<BR>
The mortal is satisfied. </P>
<P>767. When sensuality degrades, he is oppressed,<BR>
As though shot with an arrow,</P>
<P>768. Whoever drives out sensuality, like throwing out a snake with the foot, <BR>
Overcomes the diffusedness of the world mindfully. </P>
<P>769. That man who has many desires, for fields, wealth, <BR>
Gold, cattle, slaves and relations with women. </P>
<P>770. Is weakened and pressed down by them,<BR>
And comes to distress as shipwrecked. </P>
<P>771. Therefore humans, avoid sensuality mindfully,<BR>
Cross the floods and sink the boat. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">2. Guhatthaka Sutta- Concealed in a Cave. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>772. Man immersed in delusion stays protected in a cave;<BR>
He is far from seclusion. It is difficult to dispel sensuality. </P>
<P>773. Those 'agreeing to be' are not released, they do not know release, <BR>
They recollect the past and wish the future. </P>
<P>774. Humans, greedy and deluded by sensuality, heedlessly go wrong,<BR>
Fallen to unpleasantness wail, "Gone from here what will become to me". </P>
<P>775. Therefore train here itself, never do anything wrong knowing,<BR>
The wise said that life here is short. </P>
<P>776. I see the populace trembling, caught in the net of craving 'to be'<BR>
Not settled about craving to be and not to be, they cry when death comes. </P>
<P>777. Look at those appropriating, throbbing like fish in a dried up pond<BR>
Seeing this do not appropriate, be without clingings to be. </P>
<P>778. Check interests in the two extremities, thoroughly know contact free of greed<BR>
Never do anything, looked down by the wise and do not talk about the seen and heard,</P>
<P>779. Cross the flood knowing perception, when seized the sage is not soiled,<BR>
Be diligent to pull out the arrow, do not wish for this and the other world. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">3. Dutthatthaka Sutta The harsh Eight. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>780. One speaks with an evil mind, another with a pure mind,<BR>
A sage is not born from a dispute, he has no disputes what so ever. </P>
<P>781. Someone will never overstep his own view, formed with interest and liking,<BR>
Whatever he knows, that he says. </P>
<P>782. Talking about one's virtues without being asked, is boasting,<BR>
It is non- noble and evil. </P>
<P>783. The appeased, extinguished bhikkhu does not say "these are my virtues"<BR>
He has nothing to boast, it is noble and pure. </P>
<P>784. Of a Teaching arranged, compounded and honoured<BR>
The appeasement remains to be tested. It is established through a personal experience. </P>
<P>785. Views are not easy to overcome, the Teaching taken as a whole should be investigated,<BR>
And humans take up and give up views in turns. </P>
<P>786. To the wise there are no arranged views of being and non-being<BR>
They give up hypocrisy and measuring, not seizing go beyond. </P>
<P>787. The clinging have a dispute in the Teaching, the not clinging have no disputes,<BR>
Without a self or even a negated self, are free of all views. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">4. Suddhatthaka Sutta -The pure Eight. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>788. I know the highest healthy purity, which comes to humans as a view,<BR>
Knowledge arises seeing through that purity</P>
<P>789. Either the human purifies his view, or knowing dispels unpleasantness,<BR>
Knowing he purifies with substratum remaining, that view is the starting point. </P>
<P>790. No Brahmin declared purity through seeing, hearing, virtues, or an experience<BR>
Not soiled by merit and demerit, giving up the self view, and ceasing to act, he became pure. </P>
<P>791. One gives up and later seizes, with desires one does not cross the floods<BR>
This is seizing and letting go, like the monkey releasing a branch to hold another</P>
<P>792. Perceptive beings observe virtues and reach highs and lows<BR>
Knowing the Teaching that comes together in feelings do not reach highs and lows. </P>
<P>793. Not angry with anybody or anything, open to the seen, heard and experienced,<BR>
The wise have nothing to think in the world. </P>
<P>794. Do not think this is proper to honour and say this is highest purity<BR>
Give up such clingings and thoughts altogether. </P>
<P>795. The Brahmin gone beyond sin, does not say, I know and I see,<BR>
He is neither passionate nor angry and takes nothing as highest purity. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+" SIZE=5><P ALIGN="CENTER">5. Paramatthaka Sutta. -Upholding a View. </P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>796. People upholding views say all other's views are low<BR>
And they do not go beyond disputes. </P>
<P>797. Seeing some development in oneself, out of a seen, heard, virtues, or an experience,<BR>
People cling to views and see all other's views as low. </P>
<P>798. The wise said, that, that is the bond, for some reason to see others as low<BR>
Therefore the bhikkhu should not measure on account of a seen, heard, an experience or virtues. </P>
<P>799. On account of knowledge or virtues do not hold a view as this is proper</P>
<P>Do not think, I'm equal, inferior or superior<BR>
800. Dispel the self view, do not think, 'I know'<BR>
The wise are without disputes and views. </P>
<P>801. Do not wish for the two extremities of being and non-being here, or hereafter,<BR>
Think discriminately about the Teaching and have no roosting places. </P>
<P>802. Do not have any thoughts or the smallest perception, about the seen, heard, and experienced<BR>
The Brahmin is without any views and has nothing to think in this world. </P>
<P>803. Do not get established even in the Teaching, and think it is proper to honour it,<BR>
A Brahmin is not led on by virtues, crossed over, he does not turn back. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>804. Life is very short, before completing a hundred years one dies,<BR>
If one out stays that period, he dies of decay. </P>
<P>805. People grieve exacting, yet there is no permanent hold,<BR>
There is separation no doubt, seeing this do not live in a household. </P>
<P>806. All man's possessions are abandoned at death,<BR>
The wise knowing this, do not possess with affection</P>
<P>807. That which encountered in a dream, is not seen when awake,<BR>
Likewise loved ones dead and gone are not seen. </P>
<P>808. What is seen and heard of the dead is called &iuml;ame' <BR>
To talk of those dead and gone, only name remains. </P>
<P>809. Those greedy to appropriate do not give up selfish grief and wailings<BR>
The sages give up seizing and abide developing calm. </P>
<P>810. The bhikkhu withdrawn from the crowd and mentally secluded<BR>
If he does not experience the self view, that is completion. </P>
<P>811. The sage not settled anywhere, does not make friends or enemies<BR>
And selfish grief and wailings do not soil him, like drops of water the lotus leaf. </P>
<P>812. The lotus and its leaves are not soiled by drops of water,<BR>
Likewise the sage is not soiled by the seen, heard and the experienced. </P>
<P>813. The wise one does not think of the seen, heard and experienced,<BR>
He does not desire purity by some other means, he is not attached and  does not lack interest. </P>

"Venerable sir, you declare destruction to those engaged in sexual intercourse,<BR>
So, I desire a training in your dispensation"</P>
<P>815. The Blessed One said:<BR>
"Those engaged in sexual intercourse, become careless in the dispensation,<BR>
It is wrong conduct and not noble. </P>
<P>816. A certain one pursued sexual intercourse in the past, and had a downfall,<BR>
As though driving an uncontrolled vehicle</P>
<P>817. He decreased in fame and praise,<BR>
Hearing this train giving up sexual intercourse. </P>
<P>818. Pressed down with thoughts, he thinks like a beggar,<BR>
When blamed, has no words</P>
<P>819. When blamed, he also takes a weapon,<BR>
That is his greed caught in delusion. </P>
<P>820. Those engaged in sexual intercourse become dull and worried,<BR>
Therefore the wise should intend a single life. </P>
<P>821. The sage should know these earlier and later dangers,<BR>
And should intend a single life. </P>
<P>822. Train in seclusion, that is the Noble One's path,<BR>
By that do not think noble, that is imminence to extinction. </P>
<P>823. The emancipated sage free of sensual desires,<BR>
Is envied by the populace greedy for sensuality. "</P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>824. "'This only is pure, there is no purity in other Teachings'<BR>
On whatever it is established, it is an individual truth</P>
<P>825. Desiring a dispute one plunges into a crowd and calls each other a fool in turns,<BR>
He relies on others to dispute, the wise say they desire praise. </P>
<P>826. In an assembly they debate, desiring praise and fearing blame<BR>
When blamed becomes silent and angry and finds faults</P>
<P>827. When crossed questioned and shown short comings in the debate,<BR>
Grieve and wail and say 'I'm lost'</P>
<P>828. When debates arise, recluses reach highs and lows,<BR>
Seeing this give up debating, indeed, there is no good in praise</P>
<P>829. When praised for debating in a crowd, desires fulfilled,<BR>
He laughs reaching the heights</P>
<P>830. That haughtiness is his destruction, it is called conceit,<BR>
The wise say there is no purity in it, seeing this avoid disputes. </P>
<P>831. The hero partaking the best food, comes in search of an opponent,<BR>
If he is not there, he goes far in search of him. </P>
<P>832. Upholding a view he debates, saying, 'this only is the truth, what you say is not found'<BR>
A debate gives rise to enemies. </P>
<P>833. Views do not knock on views, they settle amicably,<BR>
Hero, what could you gain here, your opponent has no view to uphold. </P>
<P>834. You think and think entangled in a net of views,<BR>
The wise see the two ends meet, you cannot proceed. </P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>835. "Realizing craving, discontentment and greed, interest for sexual intercourse did not arise,<BR>
I see it as a ball of urine and excreta, and do not desire to touch it even with the foot"</P>
<P>836. "If you do not desire this jewel of a woman, aspired by many people and kings too,<BR>
Let us know your views, virtues, life and aspirations"</P>
<P>837. The Blessed One said:<BR>
"M&agrave;gandiya, taking the Teaching as a whole and discriminating</P>
<P>And not settled in views on account of a contact, I see internal appeasement grow,</P>
<P>And it does not occur to me I say this. "</P>
<P>838. The Brahmin M&agrave;gandiya said:<BR>
"From arrangements come decisions, the sage relies on decisions<BR>
Internal peace and its meaning, how is it explained by the wise. "</P>
<P>839. The Blessed One said:<BR>
"M&agrave;gandiya, not through views, hearsay or knowledge and not by observing virtues<BR>
Neither is there purity without these<BR>
Not seizing these and not supported on appeasement, should not think 'to be'</P>
<P>840. The Brahmin M&agrave;gandiya said:<BR>
"If purity is not through a view, hearsay or knowledge and not by observing virtues <BR>
And if it is neither without them, I think this a dull Teaching,<BR>
For a certain one comes to purity through a view. </P>
<P>841. The Blessed One said:<BR>
"On account of views arise doubts, with seizings arise delusion,<BR>
Here is not seen the smallest perception, so your Teaching seems to be dull and stupid</P>
<P>842. To think I'm equal, superior, or inferior is a dispute,<BR>
If you do not think in these three ways, there is no equal or superior</P>
<P>843. To what does the Brahmin say is the 'truth'. or how does he dispute it's a 'lie' <BR>
When there is no equal or superior, on what is he going to dispute. . </P>
<P>844. The sage wandering homeless, does not make friends in the village<BR>
Sensuality given up, uncaring for honourings, disputes over, how could he have an arousing. </P>
<P>845. For living in seclusion one should not be honoured as a Great Man, <BR>
The thorny stem born in the mud and water is not soiled by them,<BR>
Likewise the sage not proud of his appeasement, is not soiled by sensuality and the world. </P>
<P>846. The perfected man does not measure and become haughty on account of his view or understanding. <BR>
He is not led by actions or hearsay to make settlements. </P>
<P>847. The detached from perceptions have no bonds, the released through wisdom have no delusion. <BR>
They that value perceptions and views knock about in the world. </P>

He is not estimated and does not dispute it. </P>
