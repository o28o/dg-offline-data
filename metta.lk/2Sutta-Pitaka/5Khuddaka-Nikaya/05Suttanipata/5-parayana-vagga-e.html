</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>976. A brahmin of Kosala learned the vedas<BR>
Attained no-thingness and came south. </P>
<P>977, During the reign of Aalaka in the Assaka country<BR>
He lived on the bank of God&agrave;vari eating leaves and fruits</P>
<P>978. There was a huge village to support him<BR>
And out of its income he peformed a sacrifice. </P>
<P>979. On his return after peforming the sacrifice,<BR>
Another brahmin entered his hut. </P>
<P>980. Tired, thirsty, with unbrushed teeth and dusty hair,<BR>
He approached and begged for five hundred coins. </P>
<P>981. B&agrave;vari seeing him prepared a seat,<BR>
Inquired about his health and said:</P>
<P>982. 'Whatever I had to offer is spent,<BR>
This is the truth, I haven't five hundred coins'</P>
<P>983. "If this offering is not made,<BR>
May your top split in seven on the seventh day. "</P>
<P>984. The crafty one cursed and frightened him<BR>
B&agrave;vari hearing those words became unhappy</P>
<P>985. He emaciated without food, shot with the arrow of grief. <BR>
In that condition he could not concentrate. </P>
<P>986. A god saw him frightened and unhappy,<BR>
Desiring his good, approached and said thus:</P>
<P>987. "He does not know the top or its splitting,<BR>
Is crafty and only wants money" . </P>
<P>988. " O! good one, tell me,<BR>
The top and its splitting"</P>
<P>989. "I too do not know the the top and its splitting,<BR>
This knowledge, indeed belongs to the winners. "</P>
<P>990. "Then, O! god, tell me, who knows,<BR>
About the top and its splitting. "</P>
<P>991. "In the past, there was a world leader in Kapilavatthu,<BR>
A bright son of the S&agrave;kyas, in the lineage of Okk&agrave;ka. </P>
<P>992. Brahmin, he is enlightened, gone beyond all things,<BR>
Powerful with higher wisdom and wise about all things<BR>
And is realeased with the destruction of all endearments. </P>
<P>993. He is all enlightened, blessed, wise, and preaches the Teaching. <BR>
Approach him and ask, he will tell you. "</P>
<P>994. B&agrave;vari hearing the word 'all enlightened' became very happy,<BR>
His grief faded and joy arose to him. </P>
<P>995. B&agrave;vari pleased and over joyed asked that god,<BR>
"In which state, village or hamlet, is this leader of the world. <BR>
We like to worship the noble, enlightened two footed one"</P>
<P>996. "The wise desireless son of the S&agrave;kyas is in S&agrave;vatthi, in Kosala. <BR>
He is wise and knows the splitting of the top"</P>
<P>997. Then he addressed his learned pupils all brahmins. <BR>
"Come young men, listen to my words, . </P>
<P>998. Now the all enlightened one is born in the world,<BR>
It is something rare, go to S&agrave;vatthi and see the noble two footed one. "</P>
<P>999. "O! brahmin, seeing him, how should we know, whether he is enlightened,<BR>
Tell us how we should know it"</P>
<P>1000. "The marks of a Great Man are told in the Vedas,<BR>
There are thirty two of them told in order</P>
<P>1001. Whoever has these marks on his body,<BR>
Has two alternative behaviours</P>
<P>1002. If he leads a household life, would be a world leader<BR>
And would rule rightfully, without any weapons. </P>
<P>1003. If he leaves the household and becomes homeless<BR>
Would dispel darkness, become all enlightened and most noble. </P>
<P>1004. First mentally ask my birth, clan and marks of a Great Man,<BR>
Then ask about the top and its spllitting. </P>
<P>1005. Enlightened Ones can uncover the covered,<BR>
Mentally asked questions would be explained verbally. "</P>
<P>1006. The sixteen pupil brahmins of B&agrave;vari,<BR>
Ajita, Tissametteyya, punnaka, Mettagu,</P>

Todeyya and Kappa and Jatukanni the wise one</P>
<P>1008. Badr&agrave;udha, Udaya, Posala,<BR>
Wise Moghar&agrave;j&agrave; and the great sage Pingiya. </P>
<P>1009. Each with a following and all famous,<BR>
Wise concentraters who knew their past births. </P>
<P>1010. They all worshipped B&agrave;vari, circumbulated him<BR>
And turned northwards with braided hair. in antelope hide skin dress. </P>
<P>1011. From A&agrave;laka first to Mahiisa, then Udena,<BR>
To Gonadda, Vediisa, Vanasavhya,</P>
<P>1012. To Kosambi, S&agrave;keta, and the noble city S&agrave;vatthi<BR>
Setavya, Kapilavatthu and Kusin&agrave;r&agrave;,</P>
<P>1013. To P&agrave;v&agrave;, Boghanag&agrave;, Ves&agrave;li and Magadha,<BR>
And to the pleasant monument P&agrave;s&agrave;naka. </P>
<P>1014. Like the thirsty in search of cool water,<BR>
Or like a merchant looking for great gain,</P>
<P>Like those overcome by the heat, looking for a shade,<BR>
They hurriedly ascended the rock. </P>
<P>1015. The Blessed One that moment was preaching,<BR>
Like a lion roaring in the forest. </P>
<P>1016. Ajita saw the shining all enlightened one,<BR>
Like the completed moon on the fifteenth day. </P>
<P>1017. Seeing all the marks on his body,<BR>
Pleased and standing on a side, asked the questions mentally. </P>
<P>1018. "Of our teacher, tell the age, clan and marks of a Great Man. <BR>
How learned is he in the Vedas, and how many brahmins does he teach". </P>
<P>1019. "His age a hundred and twenty years and B&agrave;vari by clan,<BR>
Has three marks on the body, and is perfect in the three vedas</P>
<P>1020. He instructs five hundred brahmins<BR>
In Grammar, History,and the roots and meanings of words". </P>
<P>1021. "Tell the marks on noble B&agrave;vari's body,<BR>
And how is his greed, may we be not left in doubt</P>
<P>1022. "Can cover the face with the tongue, has hair between the brows,<BR>
The private parts of the body are enclosed in a bag, young men know these". </P>
<P>1023. Hearing these replies to unheard questions,<BR>
People with clasped hands consider with feelings. </P>
<P>1024. 'Which god, Brahm&agrave;, Inda or Sujampati<BR>
Asks these questions mentally, to whom are the replies'</P>
<P>1025. "B&agrave;vari asks the top and its splitting,<BR>
May the Blessed One dispel the doubts of the sages". </P>
<P>1026. "Know ignorance as the top and science as splitting the top,<BR>
Endowd with faith, mindfulness, concentration, interest and effort"</P>
<P>1027 The young men thoroughly satisfied and full of feelings,<BR>
Arranged their robes on one shoulder, and put their heads at the feet of the Blessed One. </P>
<P>1028. "Good sir, the brahmin B&agrave;vari and his pupils,<BR>
Worship the feet of the wise one with pleasure"</P>
<P>1029. "May B&agrave;vari and his pupils be with appeased minds,<BR>
May you all live long. </P>
<P>1030. If B&agrave;vari or you have any questions to ask,<BR>
Now is the time to ask them"</P>
<P>1031. Permission granted by the all Enlightened One,they sat with clasped hands,</P>

<P>The pure wise one preached what he knew</P>
<P>The benefactor is free of sensuality and greed, why should he tell lies. </P>
<P>1132. Now I eulogize and praise him,</P>
<P>He has dispelled blemish, delusion, measuring and hypocrisy. </P>
<P>1133. The all seeing Enlightened One has dispelled darkness. </P>
<P>Has overcome all and gone to the end of the world. </P>
<P>Without desires has dispelled all unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Brahm&agrave; honour me, I tell the truth. </P>
<P>1134. Like the birds that leave the nest and go to the forest with much fruits</P>
<P>I give up my narrow view and widen like the swan reaching the ocean. </P>
<P>1135. Earlier I said, that the dispensation of Gotama was for the next birth</P>
<P>It's all hearsay and developed logical talk. </P>
<P>1136. By birth he is the sun who dispelled darkness seated alone,</P>
<P>Gotama's wisdom is wide like the earth. </P>
<P>1137. He preached for the destruction of craving here and now, and for mental well being,</P>
<P>For him, there is no compare. </P>
<P>1138. Pingiya, why do you live away from him even for a moment</P>
<P>He is wise like the earth. </P>
<P>1139. He taught the healthy state of destroyed craving here and now,</P>
<P>And has no compare. </P>
<P>1140. Not that I live away from him. </P>
<P>He is wise like the earth. </P>
<P>1141. He taught the healthy state of destroyed craving here and now</P>
<P>And has no compare. </P>
<P>1142. In my mind's eye, I see the diligent brahmin day and night,</P>
<P>Throughout the night I worship him, I think I'm near him in that manner. </P>
<P>1143. I do not see, faith,,joy, and mindfulness outside the dispensation of Gotama,</P>
<P>In whatever direction the wise one is, in that direction I'm bent. </P>
<P>1144. My decayed and disabled body does not turn in that direction. </P>
<P>. My mind and thoughts are constantly engaged there. </P>
<P>1145. Submerged in the mud crying I was landing and floating in turns,</P>
<P>Then I saw the Enlightened One who had crossed over. </P>
<P>1146. As Vakkali, Bhadr&agrave;vudha and Alavi Gotama were released,</P>
<P>Pingiya, you too attain release through faith, and go beyond the domains of death. </P>
<P>1147. "I am very much pleased, hearing the words of the sage. </P>
<P>The Enlightened One has revealed, the arrow pulled out state. </P>
<P>1148. Knowing the highest gods, he taught for the here and hereafter,</P>
<P>The Teacher put an end to the doubts of the learned. </P>
<P>1149. I'm immovable and firm, I have no doubts. </P>
<P>Know me as one released in mind". </P></FONT></BODY>
