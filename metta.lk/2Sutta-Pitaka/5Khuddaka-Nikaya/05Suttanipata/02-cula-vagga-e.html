<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">3. Hir&atilde; Sutta. - Shamefulness</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>&#9;&#9;4. Mah&agrave;mangala sutta - The Great Auspices.</P>
</B><P>.</P>
<P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery of An&agrave;thapindika, in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. When the night was waxing a certain deity illuminated the whole of Jeta's grove, approached the Blessed One, worshipped, and stood on a side. Standing, addressed the Blessed One is verse.</P>
<P>258. "Many gods and men do not know the auspicious<BR>
We desire well being, may the auspices be told.</P>
<P>259. Not associating the foolish, associating the wise,<BR>
Revering those worthy of reverence, these are the auspices.</P>
<P>260. Living in a suitable surrounding, and having done merit earlier<SUP>1</SUP><BR>
And seeing to one's thorough development, these are the auspices.</P>
<P>261. Having learned much and a craft and obtaining a thorough training,<BR>
And if his words are well spoken, these are the auspices.</P>
<P>262. Attending to the needs of mother and father and seeing to the well fare of wife and sons,<BR>
And if he has a pure livelihood, these are asupices.</P>
<P>263. Giving gifts, living according the Teaching and helping relations,<BR>
And if he his actions are right, these are the auspices.</P>
<P>264. Abstained and far away from evil and refrained from taking intoxicants,<BR>
And if diligent in the Teaching, these are the auspices.</P>
<P>265. Full of reverence and humility, is satisfied and grateful<BR>
And at the suitable time listens to the Teaching, these are the auspices</P>
<P>266. Seeing recluses with patience and gentleness,<BR>
And at the right time having a discussion on the Teaching, these are the auspices.</P>
<P>267. Practising austerities, leading the holy life, realising the noble truths<BR>

<P>268 Touched by the vicissitudes of life<SUP>2</SUP> if his mind is not hurt,<BR>
Does not grieve, is not attached , is appeased, these are the auspices.</P>
<P>269. Done these things, not overcome by anything, come to well being in every way,<BR>
These are the auspices.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">5. Suciloma Sutta. To the Needle Haired Demon .</P>
</B><P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in Gaya in the domains of the demon Suciloma; the bed of sounds At that time the demons Suciloma and Khara were passing by, the place where the Blessed One was. Then the demon Khara said to the demon Suciloma &szlig;this is a recluse" Then the demon Suciloma said, &szlig;This is not a recluse, it is a s&agrave;manera, wait, I will know whether he is a recluse or a s&agrave;manera". Then the demon Suciloma approached the Blessed One and bent his body towards the Blessed One. The Blessed One pulled his body away from him. Then the demon Suciloma asked the Blessed One:"Recluse, do you fear me. " The Blessed One said: &szlig;Friend, I do not fear you, yet your contact is evil."</P>
<P>The demon said:"I will ask you a question, if you do not reply I will confuse your mind, or will spilt&nbsp;your heart, or taking by the feet will throw you to the other bank of the river. " The Blessed One said:&nbsp;&szlig;Friend, in this world of gods and men together with M&agrave;ras, Brahm&agrave;s, the community of recluses and&nbsp;brahmins, I do not see anyone who could confuse my mind, split my heart, or take me by the feet and&nbsp;throw to the other bank of the river, yet ask whatever you desire to ask. " Then the demon Suciloma,&nbsp;addressed the Blessed One in verse</P>
<P>270. &szlig;Where do greed and hate originate, and where do aversion, attachment and fear originate,<BR>
From where do thoughts and thought processes arise and come out as mock games would<BR>
for small boys</P>
<P>271. &szlig;Greed and hate originate here, so also aversion, attachment and fear,<BR>
Thought processes arise here and come out as mock games for small boys.</P>
<P>272. Arising from love it takes birth in oneself, spreading in the various sense fields,<BR>
Like the M&agrave;luv&agrave; creeper born on the banyan trunk would spread everywhere in the forest.</P>
<P>273. O! Demon, listen, they that know it, as it really is, dispel it<BR>
Cross this flood difficult to cross, and never crossed before, for not to be born again.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;<B>6. Dhammacariya Sutta. - Living according to the Teaching</P>
</B><P>274. Living according to the Teaching is said to be the ideal, and it is living the holy life.<BR>
And there are the homeless too who lead the holy life.</P>
<P>275&ograve;here are the noisy, who hurt wild animals,<BR>
Their life is evil growing in demerit</P>
<P>276. There is the deluded bhikkhu, fond of strife.<BR>
He does not know the Teaching of the Enlightened One.</P>
<P>277. Those that deludedly hurt the developed,<BR>
Do not know what is evil and what takes them to loss.</P>
<P>278. Going to loss, going from womb to womb and from dark to dark,<BR>
Such bhikkhus later come to unpleasantness.</P>
<P>279. If there be such ones, like a cess pool filled up for one year,<BR>
It is very difficult to clean them.</P>
<P>280. If you know of such worldly bhikkhus,<BR>
With evil desires, evil thoughts and evil passtures,----</P>
<P>281. All of you get together and dispel him,<BR>
Turn out the impure, throw out the rubbish</P>
<P>282. Therefore expel the non-recluse in the guise of a recluse,<BR>
Expel the evil desires and the evil pastures</P>
<P>283. It is suitable that the pure should live with the pure<BR>
Be united and clever in this manner and make an end of unpleasantness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">7. Brahmanadhammiksutta. - The Brahmin Dhammika.</P>
</B><P>I heard thus:</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery of An&agrave;thapindika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.&nbsp;Then a lot of brahmin householders of Kosala, who were decayed, aged and close upon death approached&nbsp;the Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side, and asked the Blessed One &szlig;Good Gotama&nbsp;are the qualities of ancient brahmins evident in us. " The Blessed One said: &szlig;The qualities of ancient&nbsp;brahmins are not evident today. " Then they said: &szlig;We would like to hear the qualities of the brahmins of&nbsp;yore, may the Blessed One explain them to us, if there is no inconvenience. " Then the Blessed One said:&nbsp;&szlig;Then listen brahmins, I will explain them to you. "</P>
<P>284. In the past there were sages, who were restrained like hermits<BR>
They gave up the five strands of sense pleasures and lived seeking their own good.</P>
<P>285. The brahmins did not have cattle, gold, or grains<BR>
The brshmins' treasures filled with what was given by those who had faith.</P>
<P>286. It was common to offer them food at the door<BR>
Those who had a lot of faith, thought food should be given to them.</P>
<P>287. The brahmins were offered various carriages, clothes, beds and dwellings<BR>
By those who were pleased in the states and countries.</P>
<P>288. The brahmins did no wrong, and were protected by the Teaching<BR>
No one stopped them from entering any house.</P>
<P>289. For forty eight years they protected the vow of chastity<BR>
The early brahmins were complete with their knowledges and conduct.</P>
<P>290. Brahmins never went to another's wife, nor did they buy a wife<BR>
With mutual agreement they met, on equal terms.</P>
<P>291. Except in the season,at other times they abstained from sexuality,<BR>
Brahmins never went to women out of season.</P>
<P>292. &ograve;hey honoured the holy life, virtues, straightforwardness, gentleness,<BR>
Austerities, not hurting, and also patience.</P>
<P>293. Of them the most steady one Mah&agrave; Brahm&agrave;<BR>
Did not go for sexual intercourse even in his dreams.</P>
<P>294. Those wise ones who revered him<BR>
Observed holy chastity, virtues and patience.</P>
<P>295. They begged for grains, beds, clothes, ghee and oil, collecting these rightfully<BR>
Did the sacrifice, did not kill cattle for the sacrifice.</P>
<P>296. As mother, father, brother or any other relation<BR>
The cow became their best friend, and medicine arose from the cow.</P>
<P>297. The cow gave them eatables, power, beauty and also pleasantness<BR>
Knowing this by experience, they did not kill cattle.</P>
<P>298. Brahmins with delicate huge bodies, handsome and famous were keen about their duties. ,<BR>
These people prospered as long as the forward world cycle rolled.</P>
<P>299. A corruption came to them seeing a very small thing.<BR>
The king's splendour and the decorrations of women.</P>
<P>300. Chariots yoked to thoroughbreds, beautifully painted pictures,<BR>
Getting established in houses, and allocated apartments</P>
<P>301. Cattle and much products from them and the followings of noble women<BR>
The brahmins coveted for these worldly gains.</P>
<P>302. The brahmins discussed the matter, approached king Okk&agrave;ka and asked,<BR>
&szlig;Do you like much wealth and grains, for resources and wealth make sacrifices. "</P>
<P>303. The king induced by the brahmins did various sacrifices like the horse, human,<BR>
And sacrifices done with words for good results, and gave the brahmins wealth.</P>
<P>304. Cattle, beds, clothes, women and decorated chariots,<BR>
With thoroughbreds yoked to them and beautifully painted pictures.</P>
<P>305. Beautiful houses in separate allotments filled with various kinds of grains<BR>
Were offered to the brahmins as wealth.</P>
<P>306. They gaining that wealth began to accumulate, desires awakened, their craving developed. much.<BR>
Discussing it among themselves approached king Okk&agrave;ka again.</P>
<P>307. &szlig;As water, earth, gold, wealth and grains, so the lives of cattle are accessories of humans<BR>
So make offerings of them for much resources and wealth.</P>
<P>308. The king thus informed by the brahmins<BR>
Killed hundreds and thousands of cattle in the sacrifice.</P>
<P>309. Cattle that did not hurt anyone with their feet or horns, tame like goats gave pots of milk.<BR>
The king took them by the horns and killed them with the sword.</P>
<P>310. Inda the king of demons looked down on it as `injustice'<BR>
To destroy cattle with the sword.</P>
<P>311. In the past there were three diseases: desires, constipation and decay.<BR>
With the destruction of cattle ninety eight diseases arose.</P>
<P>312. This is unrighteous punishment, straying from the ancients,<BR>
Killing those who have done no wrong and the priests were punished by the Teaching.</P>
<P>313. The ancient wise looked down at these very small things<BR>
When the priests had these qualities people degraded them.</P>
<P>314. With these corruptions there came a split as slaves, householders and warriors<BR>
And husband and wife quarrelled with each other.</P>
<P>315. Warriors, brahmins and any others of good stock,<BR>
Dishonoured their birthrights and were ruled by actions."</P>
<P>When this was said the brahmin householders said: &szlig;Good Gotama, now we know. It seems as though&nbsp;something over turned is re-installed. Something covered was made manifest, Or as the path was told&nbsp;to one who had lost his way. Or it seems as though an oil lamp was lighted for the darkness, so that&nbsp;those who have eyes could see forms. Good Gotama has explained the Teaching in varioous ways.&nbsp;Now we take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community. May we be remembered&nbsp;as taken refuge from today until life lasts. "</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">8 N&agrave;v&agrave;sutta. The Ship.</P>
</B><P>316. When a man learns the Teaching, gods worship him as they worship Inda,<BR>
Worshipped, he becomes pleased and becomes learned in the Teaching.</P>
<P>317. The attentive wise one falls to the method of living according to the Teaching.<BR>
Then he beomes wise and clever and diligently finds equals to associate.</P>
<P>318. Those associating the inferior foolish ones not come to essence and growth,<BR>
Here itself do not come to any growth and die, doubts not dispelled.</P>
<P>319. A man who has descended a great expanse of water with a swift current,<BR>
While he is carried away by the stream, is it possible that he should teach others to cross.</P>
<P>320. Likewise not developed in the Teaching, not attentive, when explained by the learned,<BR>
Oneself not knowing, without doubts dispelled, is it possible that he could teach others.</P>
<P>321. Like one embarking a ship quite confidently, with oar and rudder close at hand,<BR>
Would help many others to cross, the wise clever one crosses others.</P>
<P>322. Even so the perfected developed one becomes learned in the not feeling Teaching. <SUP>1</SUP><BR>
He knows to teach others. Listen to him to attain paths and fruits.</P>
<P>323. Therefore associate Great Men<SUP>2</SUP> who are wise and learned.<BR>

At the right time arouse a talk on the Teaching, and listen to the good words attentively</P>
<P>326. From time to time go to see your own teachers, dispel pride and attend gently on them,.<BR>
Be mindful of the essence in the Teaching, the restraints and the holy life.</P>
<P>327. Be fond of the Teaching, attached to it, established in it , be a wise discriminative thinker of it,<BR>
Never go about looking for faults in the Teaching, think logicslly of good words.</P>
<P>328. Give up laughter, mutterings, laments, angry talk, crafty talk, malice and the greedy mind,<BR>
Be free from the blemishes that arise from stuborness, give up pride and abide seeing reality.</P>
<P>329. Learn the essence in good words, the heard, experienced and the essence in concentration,<BR>
The negligent violent man's wisdom and learning does not grow</P>

<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the Aggal&agrave;va monument, in Aalav&atilde;. At that time, venerable&nbsp;Vang&atilde;sa's preceptor , Venerable Nigrodhakappa by name had passed away into final extinction recently.&nbsp;When venerable Vang&atilde;sa was secluded and concentrated this thought occured to him; `Has my teacher&nbsp;passed into final extinction, or has he not. Then venerable Vang&atilde;sa getting up from his seclusion in the&nbsp;evening approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side, and said thus to the Blessed One. :"Venerable sir, in my seclusion, this thought arose to me, `has my teacher passed into final extinction, or has he not.

<P>343. &szlig;We ask the Teacher of incomparable wisdom, who could dispel doubts here and now<BR>
Has the famous bhikkhu of Aggal&agrave;va who has passed away, attained extinction.</P>
<P>344. He was Nigrodhakappa by name, and was ordained by you sir,<BR>
He abode worshipping you with one single aim, with aroused effort and steadfast undertaking.</P>

<P>356. I am very happy hearing these words of the seventh sage.<BR>
My question is fruitful, The brahmin did not hide the fact.</P>
<P>357. The disciple of the Enlightened One did what he said,<BR>
Crossed over the net laid by Death the crafty one, thoroughhly</P>
<P>358. The Blessed One even earlier knew about Kapp&agrave;yana<BR>
He has thoroughly crossed over the domains of Death.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">13. Samm&agrave;paribb&agrave;janiyasutta. - The rightful going forth.</P>
</B><P>359. &szlig;I ask the wise sage, who has crossed over and is extinguished in the highest,<BR>
To one who has left home and given up sensuality, what is the rightful going forth.</P>
<P>360. The Blessed One said:<BR>
If ideas of the auspices, omens, dreams and signs are given up,<BR>
Together with the corruptions of the auspices, that is the rightful going forth.</P>

Not supported and not led on by another, that is the rightful going forth.</P>
<P>365. Knowing the Teaching correctly, not averse to words, ideas and actions<BR>
Become one intent on attaining extinction, that is the rightful going forth.</P>
<P>366. If the bhikkhu is not proud `I am worshipped' and does not resent rebuked,<BR>
Gaining food from others is not intoxicated, that is the rightful going forth.</P>
<P>367. Giving up greed and wishing, removed from cutting and binding,<BR>
Doubts dispelled and the arrow pulled out, that is the rightful going forth.</P>
<P>368. Knowing what is useful for oneself, does not hurt anyone in the world,<BR>
Learns the reality embedded in the Teaching,<SUP>2</SUP> that is the rightful going forth.</P>
<P>369. When there are no latent tendencies what so ever, demerit removed together with the roots<BR>
The bhikkhu becomes free of hunger and desires, that is the rightful going forth.</P>

Allowing all endearments to fade, the bhikkhu rightfully goes forth".</P>
<P>375. &szlig;Indeed, the Blessed One is such, that he lives the life of a tamed bhikkhu,<BR>
Overcoming all bonds, that he rightfully goes forth. "</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">14. Dhammikasutta- The disciple Dhammika.</P>
</B><P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapindika in Jeta's grove in&nbsp;S&agrave;vatthi. Dhammika the disciple with five hundred other disciples approached the Blessed One worshipped, sat on a side and addressed the Blessed One in verses.</P>
<P>376. &szlig;I ask wise Gotama, one gone forth, or a disciple from a household,<BR>
Doing what would he be doing the right thing.</P>
<P>377. You know the movements of worldlings, gods, and of those gone beyond<BR>
There is no one who would know the highest good better, therefore you are enlightened.</P>
<P>378. All knowledge of the perfect Teaching, you preached out of compassion for humans<BR>
You rolled over the veil, a seer of all, illuminated and purified the whole world.</P>
<P>379. The great elephant Er&agrave;vana came to your presence, knew you were the winner<BR>
The matter being discussed by you, he became happy.</P>
<P>380. Vessavana the king of the Kuveras too approached to ask questions<BR>
Sir, you answered his questions too, hearing them he became happy.</P>
<P>381. All these heratical disputants, even the Aajivakas and the Nigantas .<BR>
Do not come up to your wisdom, it is like standing and running fast.</P>
<P>382. All these disputant brahmins, even those elderly brahmins<BR>
Or any others who think of disputing have to learn something good from you.</P>
<P>383. This Teaching well proclaimed by you is clever and pleasant,<BR>
We all want to hear you, so chief of enlightened ones preach it.</P>
<P>384. All these seated bhikkhus and also the lay disciples want to hear it,<BR>
The Teaching bound to purity like the good words of V&agrave;sava. "<SUP>6</P>
</SUP><P>385. &szlig;O! Bhikkhus, listen and bear it all, I will give the Teaching which chaffs<SUP>7</SUP><BR>
The postures, reflections of one gone forth, expecting your good,wisely follow them.</P>
<P>386. The bhikkhu should not wander for alms in the village at untimely hours<BR>
Wandering at untimely hours calls for trouble, enlightened ones do not do it.</P>
<P>387. Humans are intoxicated by forms, sounds, tastes, smells and contacts,<BR>
Dispelling interest for these things, at the right time should go for alms</P>
<P>388. The bhikkhu gaining morsel food rightfully, should return alone and sit secluded<BR>
Mental faculties turned inwards should utter words of sympathatic nature.</P>
<P>389. If he talks with disciples or even with some other bhikkhu,<BR>
Should not slander or blame another, but recite a suitable example.</P>
<P>390. Some are pulled about with disputes, I do not praise it, there's little wisdom there.<BR>
Once and again they fall into trouble, and so their minds go far from the point</P>
<P>391. Morsel food, dwellings, beds and seats, water and robes to turn out dirt,<BR>
Hearing the words of the Well Gone One the wise bhikkhu should use them discriminately</P>
<P>392. Therefore the bhikkhu using morsel food, beds and seats, water and robes to turn out dirt,<BR>
Should not be soiled, like drops of water on the lotus leaf.</P>
<P>393. I will tell the behaviour of disciples from a household too, doing what it would be fruitful,<BR>
They do not get a chance to experience the ways of a bhikkhu completely.</P>
<P>394. Do not hurt or kill living things, do not give the concent for others to hurt<BR>
Give up punishing all, those infirm and also firm</P>
<P>395. Refrain from taking what is not given, any small thing that the disciple partakes,<BR>
Do not carry away anything, or g ive the concent for others to do it. Never take anything not offered.</P>
<P>396. Avoid unholy life, as the wise would avoid a pit of burning embers,<BR>
Those that cannot observe the holy life, should at least not go to others' wives.</P>
<P>397. Gone to an assembly, or in a crowd for any reason do not tell lies.<BR>
Do not induce others to tell lies . Do never tell a lie.</P>
<P>398. If this Teaching is dear to any householder, he should give up taking intoxicating drinks<BR>
Knowing it as madness should not drink, nor induce others to drink,</P>
<P>399. Fools intoxicated do demerit, and also causes others to fall into negligence<BR>
Avoid that demeritorious sphere, the deluded madness of fools.</P>
<P>400. Refrain from destroying life, taking what is not given, telling lies and intoxicants<BR>
Lead the holy life, abstain from sexuallity do not partake food at night and at untimely hours</P>
<P>401. Do not bear flowers and anoint scents, sleep on a cover spread on the floor.<BR>
The eight precepts are declared for the full moon day, by the enlightened one to end unpleasantness.</P>
<P>402. On the fourteenth fifteenth and eighth days of the waxing side observe the eight precepts<BR>
On these special days observing the precepts with a pleasant mind be accomplished.</P>
<P>403. Observing the eight precepts early, serve the community of bhikkhus with eatables and drinks<BR>
The wise share their belongings with a pleasant mind.</P>
<P>404. Rightfully look after mother and father and be engaged in a trade that is rightful<BR>
These are the diligent observances of a householder to be born with the gods of their own effulgence.</P>
