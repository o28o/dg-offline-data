<P>at one time the Gracious One was dwelling near S&agrave;vatthi at An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's grounds in Jeta's Wood. Then a certain god, at the end of the night, having lit up the whole of Jeta's Wood with his surpassing beauty, approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he stood on one side. While standing on one side that god recited this verse to the Gracious One:</P>

And may they listen carefully to what is said.</LI>
<LI>Therefore, all of you beings, be attentive,<BR>
Be friendly towards this generation of men,<BR>
They who bring offerings by day and by night,<BR>
As they are heedful please protect them.</LI>
<LI>Whatever riches there are - here or hereafter<BR>
Or in the heavens - that excellent treasure<BR>
Is not equal unto the Realised One -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Buddha:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>(Craving's) end, dispassion, deathlessness, excellence -<BR>
That which the concentrated Sakyan sage attained -<BR>
There is nothing that is equal to the Dhamma -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Dhamma:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>That which the great Buddha praised as being pure -<BR>
The concentration said to have immediate (result) -<BR>
No equal to that concentration is found -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Dhamma<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>Those eight individuals praised by the good -<BR>
There are these four pairs (of persons) -<BR>
Those disciples of the Happy One are worthy of gifts,<BR>
Those things that have been given to them have great fruit -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>Those who have firm minds that are devoted to<BR>
Gotama's teaching, being free from sense desire -<BR>
Having attained and entered the deathless -<BR>
Are enjoying the stillness, obtained for free -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>Just as a locking post stuck fast in the earth<BR>
Does not waver on account of the four winds,<BR>
Just like this, I say, is the person who is true,<BR>
The one who sees the noble truths completely -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>Those who clearly distinguish the noble truths,<BR>
Which have been well preached by the one with great wisdom,<BR>
No matter how great they become in heedlessness<BR>
Still they do not take up an eighth existence -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>Together with his attainment of seeing (Nibb&agrave;na)<BR>
There are three things that are given up:<BR>
Embodiment view, uncertainty, and<BR>
Whatever (grasping at) virtue and practices there is.<BR>
He is free from (rebirth in) the four lower worlds,<BR>
And he is incapable of the six great crimes -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>Whatever bad actions he performs<BR>
By way of body, speech, or mind,<BR>
He is incapable of covering it up:<BR>
This incapacity is said of one who has seen the state (of peace) -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>Just like a tall woodland tree crowned with flowers<BR>
In the summer months, in the early summer,<BR>
Just like this he preached the Dhamma which is best,<BR>
Which goes to Nibb&agrave;na, the highest benefit -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Buddha:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>The best one, knowing the best, gave the best, brought the best,<BR>
He preached the best Dhamma, which is unsurpassed -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Buddha:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>
<LI>The old is destroyed, and nothing new is produced,<BR>
Their minds are unexcited by future rebirth,<BR>
They have destroyed the seeds, and have no desire for growth,<BR>
The wise are still, just as this lamp (is still) -<BR>
This excellent treasure is in the Sangha:<BR>
By virtue of this truth may there be safety!</LI>

No one remembers these beings, because of their (past unwholesome) deeds,</LI>
