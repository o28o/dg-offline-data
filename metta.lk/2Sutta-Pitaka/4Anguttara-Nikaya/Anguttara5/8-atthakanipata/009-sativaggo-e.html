<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, what is the reason that on a certain day the teachings of The Blessed One becomes evident to me and on another day it does not become evident to me?"</P>
<P>&szlig;Punniya, the bhikkhu has faith, does not approach the Thus Gone One and the Teachings do not become evident to him.

You should reply the wandering ascetics thus: Friends, the origin of all things is interest, its beginning is attention, all things arise with a contact, they move with feelings, the foremost for all things is concentration, the authority for all things is mindfulness, all things are ennobled in wisdom and the essence for all things is release.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>009.06. At one time The Blessed One was touring the country of Kosala with a large Community of bhikkhus and entered the Brahmin hamlet Icchanagala and lived in the forest stretch of Icchanagala. The Brahmin householders of Icchanagtala heard that the good recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyas gone forth from the Sakya clan has come to Icchanagala and lives in the forest stretch there. The good name, spread about that good Gotama- That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and Blessed. He teaches to this world together with its gods, M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the community of recluses and Brahmins, the Teaching he had known and realized, good at the beginning, in the middle and the end, purely and completely explaining the holy life. It is good to see such worthy ones. Then the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala at the end of that night carrying a lot of eatables and nourishments approached the forest stretch of Icchangala, and they stood outside the entrance making a lot of noise.</P>
<P>At that time venerable Nagita attended on The Blessed One and The Blessed One addressed venerable Nagita: Nagita, who makes such great noise, like hauling a catch of fish. Venerable sir, they are the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala standing outside, come with a lot of eatables and nourishments for The Blessed One and the Community of bhikkhus Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, the enjoyment of gain, honour and fame&yacute;ay it not come to me. It is vile and sluggish pleasure in comparison to this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, may The Blessed One tolerate. Well Gone One, it is the right time to give consent. Wherever The Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or state, the Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. Like huge drops of rain that fall would turn towards the inclines. In the same manner, wherever The Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or state, the Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. What is the reason? It is on account of the virtues and wisdom of The Blessed One.</P>
<P>Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, the enjoyment of gain, honour and fame&yacute;ay it not come to me. It is vile and sluggish pleasure in comparison to this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly. The enjoyment of gain, honour and fame is a vile and sluggish pleasure.</P>
<P>Nagita, certain gods too do not enjoy this emanciption from worldliness, the pleasure of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, this non-sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly. Nagita, to you living with a crowd, living in a company, it occurs: `If this venerable one was not a gainer of this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasure of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, this non-sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly, he would have lived with the crowd, enjoying the company.</P>
<P>Here, Nagita, I see bhikkhus pointing fingers at each other joking and playing then it occurs to me: Since these venerable ones are not the gainers of this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasure of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, this non-sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly, which I now enjoy, they point fingers at each other, joke and play.</P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, who eat as much as they like and abide enjoying the pleasure of sleep and sluggishness- Nagita, then it occurs to me: 'Since these venerable ones are not the gainers of this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasure of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, this non-sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly, which I now enjoy, that they eat as much as they like and abide enjoying the pleasure of sleep and sluggishness.</P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the out skirts of the village, seated distracted, then it occurs to me: These venerable ones either offend forest bhikkhus or novices, therefore they fall from their concentration. Nagita, then I am not pleased with their living in the out skirts of the village.</P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the forest dozing away seated, then it occurs to me: These venerable ones dispelling their sleepiness should develop the perception of forest, attending to the perception of solidarity Nagita, then I am pleased with their living in the forest.</P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the forest seated distracted, then it occurs to me: These venerable ones either should concentrate their minds or should protect their concentrated minds Nagita, then I am not pleased with their living in the forest.</P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the forest, seated and concentrated, then it occurs to me: These venerable ones should either release their unreleased minds or protect their released minds&ouml;agita, then I am not pleased with their living in the forest.</P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the out skirts of the village, the gainers of robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill &ograve;hey desiring that gain honour and fame give up forest dwellings and jungle paths and come to hamlets, villages and states and make their dwellings. Nagita, then I am not pleased with their living in the out skirts of the village.</P>

<P>Nagita, when I come to the highway, if I do not see anyone in front or behind, at that time I find it pleasant, at least for the purpose of urinating and excreting.</P>
