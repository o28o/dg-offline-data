Venerable sir, we are known as charming goddesses, are superior and wield power over others in these three instances.</P>
<P>Then venerable sir, it occured to me: &szlig;All these goddesses should be blue, clothed and decorated in blue. Those goddesses knowing my thought, all became blue, dressed and decorated in blue.</P>
<P>Then it occured to me: &szlig;All these goddesses should be yellow, ... re ... red, ... re ... white, ... re ... clothed and decorated in white. Those goddesses knowing my thought, all became white, dressed and decorated in white.</P>
<P>One of these goddesses sang, another danced and the other clapped to tune. Just as the fivefold music is in conformity to each other well trained and struck together and is with lovely words, enticing, capturing the mind and intoxicating, the sound of those goddesses were also with lovely words, enticing, capturing the mind and intoxicating. Then venerable sir, I restrained my mental faculties.</P>
<P>Then those goddesses saying venerable Anuruddha does not enjoy, did not sing and disappeared from there. Venerable sir, endowed with how many things do women after death are born with the charming goddesses?</P>
<P>Anuruddha, women endowed with eight things are born with the goddesses of charm after death. What eight?</P>
<P>Here, Anuruddha, the woman when given by her mother and father to whomever husband she lives with him desiring his good compassionate towards him and arousing compassion rising before him, going to bed after him, looking out to see what should be done for him and speaking pleasantly.</P>
<P>Whoever elders be in the family of the husband mother or father or recluses and Brahmins reveres and honours them. At their arrival offers them seats and water.</P>
<P>Whatever work there be in the husband's house to make cotton or silk yarn, she becomes clever, not lazy looking out to see what should be done and getting it done.</P>
<P>Whoever be the slaves, messengers and workmen in the husband's home she knows who does the work and who does not do the work. She knows the sick, the powerful and the weak. She divides the eatables and nourishments among them up to the last.</P>
<P>Whatever the husband brings wealth, grains, gold and silver, she protects them without a thievish mind, without anger with a non -fondling and non-destructive mind.</P>
<P>She is a lay disciple who has taken refuge in the enlightenment, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus.</P>
<P>She is virtuous, abstaining from, destroying living things, taking the not given, misbehaviour in sexuality, telling lies, and taking intoxicating and brewed drinks.</P>
<P>She is benevolent with a mind free from the stains of selfishness, with open hands ready to give to the needy and arranging such gifts.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, women endowed with these eight things are born with the goddesses of pleasantness after death.</P><DIR>
