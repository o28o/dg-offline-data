<P>For the third time The Blessed One said: &szlig;Gotami, it is not suitable, that women gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One,&oacute;o not pursue it"</P>
<P>Then Mahapajapati Gotami thinking The Blessed One does not give permission for women to gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One was displeased and crying, worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One went away.</P>
<P>The Blessed One living as long as he desired in Kapilavatthu went touring to Vesali and in stages arrived there. In Vesali The Blessed One lived in the gabled hall in the Great forest.</P>
<P>Then Mahapajapati Gotami shaving her head and putting on yellow clothes with many daughters of the Sakyas went to Vesali and in stages arrived at the gabled hall in the Great forest. When arriving there she was with injured feet, dusty and dirty body displeased and crying.</P>
<P>Venerable &acirc;nanda, saw her with injured feet, dusty and dirty body displeased and crying.</P>
<P>standing outside and asked her: &szlig;Gotami why are you with injured feet, dusty and dirty body, displeased, crying and standing outside?"</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, The Blessed One does not give permission for women to gain the leaving home and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One."</P>

<P>Then it occured to venerable &acirc;nanda: 'The Blessed One does not give permission for the women's going forth and becoming homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One. What if I try some other method to beg the going forth for women in the dispensatlion declared by the Thus Gone One.' Venerable &acirc;nanda, said thus to The Blessed One: &szlig;Venerable sir, is it possible for women gone forth and become homeless in the dispensation declared by the Thus Gone One to realize the fruits of entry into the stream of the Teaching or the fruits of returning once or the fruits of not returning, or the fruits of worthiness?"</P>

<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, if women did not obtain the going forth from the household as homeless, in the dispensation of the Thus Gone One, the dispensation would have lasted longer a thousand years &acirc;nanda, as women have obtined the going forth from the household to become homeless, it will not last long, the good Teaching will last only five hundred years.</P>

<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, we live a household life enjoying sensual pleasures troubled by wife and children, wearing Kashmire clothes, bearing flowers, scents, ointments and earning gold and silver. Venerable sir, may The Blessed One teach me for my welfare and pleasantness here and now and here after.</P>
<P>&szlig;Byagghapajja, these four things conduce to the welfare and pleasantness of sons of clansmen here and now. What four?</P>
<P>The achievement of, manly vigour, means of protection, good friendship and a balanced living.</P>
<P>Byagghapajja, what is the achievement of manly vigour?</P>
<P>Here, Byagghapajja, in whatever trade the clansman makes a living -whether farming, trading, cattle rearing, rulership, serving the king or any other skill, he becomes clever not lazy and discriminative of what, has to be done and what has to be completed.

<P>Byagghapajja, what is the achievement of protection?</P>
<P>Here, Byagghapajja, whatever wealth be to the clansman achieved through manly vigour, righteously gained when toiling with his hands while sweat dripped, he protects. This my wealth should be protected so that it would not be carried away by the king, by robbers or water or burnt by fire. It should not be carried away by unwanted inheritors.

If the clansman's son with high income was to live spending little. It is said that the clansman's son lives as though dying a junior death. Byagghapajja, when the clansman's son balances his income with the expenses and lives, it is said he is balanced in expenses.</P>
<P>Byagghapajja, to thus arisen wealth there are four sources of loss. - Fondness for, women, intoxicants, gambling and associating evil friends, and close associations of evil friendships.
