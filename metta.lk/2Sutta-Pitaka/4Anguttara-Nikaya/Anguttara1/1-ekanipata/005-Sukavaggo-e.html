<P>42. Bhikkhus, it is possible that a man stepping on or handling an awn of rice or barly placed in a particular manner should cut his skin and hurt himself and blood will ooze. In the same manner with the mind correctly established the bhikkhu should penetrate ignorance and realize extinction is possible. This is the second.</P>
<P>43. Bhikkhus, I penetratingly see the defiled mind of a certin person thus: 'If this person dies this moment, he will be born in hell as though led and lain there, as a result of his defiled mind.' Bhikkhus, on account of a defiled mind, someone may be born in loss, in an evil state, in hell. This is the third. </P>
<P>44. Bhikkhus, I penetratingly see the pure mind of a certin person thus: 'If this person dies this moment, he will be born in heaven as though led and lain there, as a result of his pure mind.' Bhikkhus, on account of a pure mind, someone may be born in gain, in a good state, in heaven. This is the fourth.</P>
<P>45. Bhikkhus, it is not possible that a man standing on the bank of a disturbed muddy pond would see shells, pebbles, stones and fish moving or stationary in the water. In the same manner it is not possible that the bhikkhu with a disturbed mind would see his own good, the good of a another, or realize something noble and above human. It's the fifth. </P>
<P>46. Bhikkhus, it is possible that a man standing on the bank of an undisturbed pond with pure clear water would see shells, pebbles, stones and fish moving and stationary in it. In the same manner it is possible that the bhikkhu with an undisturbed mind would see his own good, the good of another, or realize something noble and above human. It's the sixth. </P>
<P>47. Bhikkhus, of all kinds of wood the sandle wood is the foremost in its softness and adaptability. In the same manner the developed mind when made much is soft and adaptable. It's the seventh. </P>
<P>48. Bhikkhus, the mind changes quickly. There is no comparison to the quickly changing nature of the mind. It's the eighth. </P>
<P>49. Bhikkhus, the mind is effulgent, it is defiled by external defilements.</P>
<P>50. Bhikkhus. the mind is effulgent, when released from external defilelment. </P></FONT></BODY>
