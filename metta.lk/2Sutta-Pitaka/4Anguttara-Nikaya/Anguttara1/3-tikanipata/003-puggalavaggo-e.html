<P>21. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. Then venerable Savi&ntilde;&ntilde;ha and venerable Mah&agrave;ko&ntilde;&ntilde;hita approached venerable S&agrave;riputta, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side.

<P>The Blessed One said: S&agrave;riputta, it cannot be stated easily, of these three persons, which one is more pleasing and excellent.

<P>The second sick person, whether he gains or does not gain suitable food, medicine and a suitable attendant, he recovers from that illness.</P>
<P>The third sick person gains not that he does not gain, suitable food, medicine and a suitable attendant and he recovers from that illness.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, on account of this sick person, who gains not that he does not gain, suitable food, medicine and a suitable attendant and recovers from that illness, I grant the supplication of suitable food, medicine and a suitable attendant for the sick. Bhikkhus, on account of this sick person other sick persons should be attended to. These three sick persons are evident in the world.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner there are three persons in the world comparable to these three sick persons. Which three?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a certain person whether he gains sight of the Thus Gone One or does not gain sight of the Thus Gone One, whether he hears the Teaching and Discipline of the Thus Gone One or does not hear it, he does not enter the right path to become proficient in meritorious thoughts.</P>

<P>4. Bahuk&agrave;rasutta&uuml; &Yacute; Has done much</P>
<P>24. Bhikkhus, these three persons have done much to a person. Which three? Bhikkhus, the person gone to whom this person takes refuge in the Enlightenment, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. .</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the person gone to whom this person knows as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness.</P>

<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person with a mind comparable to a sore? Bhikkhus, a certain person is angry and has grudges. When a few words are told he becomes angry, swears and retorts angrily showing anger and displeasure, like a festered sore touched by a clod or stone would ooze much pus.

<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person with a mind comparable to lightning? Bhikkhus, a certain person knows, as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is its cessation and this is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. Just as a man would see forms in pitch darkness when there is lightning. In the same manner a certain person knows as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person with a mind comparable to a diamond? Bhikkhus, a certain person having destroyed desires, the mind released and released through wisdom abides here and now by himself realizing. Bhikkhus, just as there is nothing that a diamond would not cut, a gem or a stone.

<P>&nbsp;6. Sevitabbasutta&uuml; &Yacute; Should be associated</P>
<P>26. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. What three? Bhikkhus, there is a person that should not be associated, there is one that should be associated and there is another that should be honoured and revered and associated.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person that should not be associated? Bhikkhus, a certain person is below par in virtues, concentration and wisdom. Such should not be associated unless out of sympathy and compassion.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person that should be associated? Bhikkhus, a certain person is par in virtues, concentration and wisdom. Such should be associated. What is the reason? Those par in virtues converse on virtues, those par in concentration converse on concentration and those par in wisdom converse on wisdom.

<P>Bhikkhus, who is the person that should be honoured, revered and associated? Bhikkhus, a certain person is much above in virtues, concentration and wisdom. Such should be honoured, revered and associated. What is the reason? I will complete virtues not yet completed, will be satisfied seeing my completed virtues, then and there.

Here a certain person is unvirtuous, with evil thoughts like rubbish, with secret actions, with only a promise to recluseship, festering inside and filth oozing out. Bhikkhus, this kind of person should be loathed, should not be associated. What is the reason? In some way if this person is not imitated, ill fame spreads, this is an evil friend, an associate of evil. Just as a serpent with excreta on its body would not sting anyone, for he smears excreta. In the same manner an unvirtuous person with evil thoughts similar to rubbish, with secret actions, with only a promise to recluseship, festering inside and filth oozing out should be loathed, should not be associated.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what kind of person should be carefully watched, not associated? Bhikkhus, a certain person is angry and has grudges. When a few words are told he becomes angry swears and retorts angrily showing anger and displeasure, like a festered sore touched by a clod or stone would ooze much pus. Or like a heap of rotting food in a monastery when hit with a clod or stone would give a hissing sound. Or like a heap of excreta when hit with a clod or stone would give an evil smell Bhikkhus, in like manner a person with a mind comparable to a sore is angry, has grudges and when a few words are told he becomes angry, swears and retorts angrily showing anger and displeasure. Bhikkhus, this person should be carefully watched, not associated. What is the reason? He may scold me, rebuke me and do me some harm.

<P>29. Bhikkhus, these three persons are evident in the world. What three? The blind man, the man with one unimpaired eye and the man with unimpaired eyes. Bhikkhus, who is the blind man? Bhikkhus, this person is not clever to acquire wealth that is not acquired and to prosper on wealth already acquired He is blind to it. Further he hasn't the eye to know merit and demerit, the fault and non fault, the non-exalted and exalted and the counterparts of purity and impurity.

Associate the man with unimpaired eyes. Of the three he is the best.</P></DIR>

Getting up from his seat, he becomes confused and forgets<BR>
The one with wide wisdom is the best<BR>
Constantly going to the bhikkhus he learns from the beginning to the end<BR>
