<P>(3) Exertions (a)</P>
<P>Brethren, there are these four proper Exertions. Which four? Brethren, here. (in the world) a brother begets a desire, exerts himself, puts forth endeavour and strenuously applies his mind to prevent the arising of sinful conditions not yet. arisen, to put away sinful conditions that have arisen, to produce meritorious conditions that have not yet arisen, and to promote, increase, preserve, develop* and perfect meritorious conditions that have arisen. These, brethren, are the four proper Exertions.</P><DIR>

<P>4. Exertions (b)</P>
<P>Brethren, there are these four Exertions. Which four? The Exertion to control, the Exertion to put away, the Exertion to develop and the Exertion to preserve.</P>
<P>Brethren, what is the Exertion to control? Here (in the world) a brother seeing a bodily form is not entranced by the general appearance or the details of it. Because, in him who dwells with the eye uncontrolled, sinful conditions of covetousness or discontent may come into being, therefore he watches, guards and brings the eye into subjection. Hearing a sound with the ear, smelling an odour with the nose, feeling a taste with the tongue or a contact with the body, or thinking a thought with the mind, he is not entranced by the general qualities or the details of it. Because, in him who dwells with the mind controlled, sinful conditions of covetousness or discontent may come into being, he watches, guards and brings the mind into subjection. Brethren, this is said to be the Exertion to control.</P>
<P>Brethren, what is the Exertion to put away? Here (in the world) a brother yields not to a sensual thought, an angry thought or a cruel thought that has arisen, but rejects, expels or frees himself from them or causes them to perish. Brethren, this is said to be the Exertion to put away.</P>
<P>Brethren, what is the Exertion to develop? Here (in the world) a brother develops the Factor of Knowledge (called) Recollection, which results in peace, passionlessness and cessation and leads to the extinction of lust. He also develops the Factors of Knowledge (called) Investigation, Energy, Serenity, Rapture, Concentration and Equanimity,'</P>
<P>1 The Seven Bojjhangas</P>
<P>ii. [14] On Behaviour 21</P>
<P>which result in peace, passionlessness and cessation, and also lead to the extinction of lust. Brethren, this is said to be the Exertion to develop.</P>
<P>Brethren, what is the Exertion to preserve? Here (in the world) a brother carefully guards the auspicious mental reflex of concentration' and meditates upon the ideas of a skeleton, a worm-infested corpse, a discoloured or festering corpse, a corpse with cracked skin, or a bloated corpse. This, brethren, is said to be the Exertion to preserve.</P><DIR>

<P>(5) Designations</P>
<P>Brethren, there are these four great Designations. Which four? Brethren, among those who have bodily forms Rahu the King of Asuras is chief. Among those addicted to sensual pleasures King Mandh&agrave;t&agrave;* is chief. Among those endowed with power Mora the Sinful is chief. Brethren, in the world of the gods, M&agrave;ras, Br&agrave;hmas, also among all beings whether recluses, br&agrave;hmins, devas or men, the</P>

Above, across, and back again returning,<BR>

The Buddha is proclaimed the Chief of gods and men.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(6) Subtilties</P>
<P>Brethren, there are these four Subtilties.* Which four? Herein, a brother is endowed with the subtilty of the body, the sensations, the perceptions and the dispositions. Thus owing to his Subtilty of the body, the sensations, the perceptions and the dispositions, he neither seeks nor aims at any higher or more excellent form of Subtilty of the body, the sensations, the perceptions or the dispositions. These, brethren, are the four Subtilties.</P><DIR>

<P>(7) Wrong Behaviour</P>
<P>Brethren, there are the these four (kinds of) wrongful behaviour. Which four? One falls into wrong behaviour owing to Desire, Ill-will, Illusion or Fear.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Desire, Ill-will, Illusion, Fearfulness<BR>
Whoso, by these misled, doth break the Law,<BR>
His good name fades away, as wanes the moon<BR>

<P>(8) Right Behaviour</P>

<P>Which four? One falls not into wrong behaviour owing to Desire, Ill-will, Illusion or Fear..</P>

<P>(10) Distribution of Food</P>
<P>Brethren, he who regulates the distribution of food, surely as a load,* falls into Purgatory owing to four things. Owing to which, four? He does wrong' owing to Desire, Ill-will, illusion or Fear. Brethren, he who regulates the distribution of food is thus re-born in heaven, even as a load is laid down, if he does no wrong owing to Desire, Ill will, Illusion or Fear.</P><DIR>
