<P>(1) Yields in Merit (a)</P>
<P>BRETHERN there are these four yields in merit and virtue, which bring about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results, and lead to heavenly life, conducing to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing. What are the four?</P>
<P>Brethren, a brother, whilst wearing a robe given by any one, dwells in the attainment of boundless concentration of the mind. To him accrues a yield in merit and virtue, which brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results and leads to heavenly life, conducting to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>

<P>of mind. To him accrues a yield in merit and virtue which brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results and leads to heavenly life, conducting to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>
<P>Brethren, a brother, whilst using the requisites for medicine and support for the sick offered by any one, dwells in the attainment of boundless concentration of the mind. To him accrues a yield in merit and virtue which brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results and leads to heavenly life, conducting to good, to welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>
<P>Indeed, brethren, the merit of the Ariyan disciple, who is endowed with these four yields in merit and virtue, is not easy to measure. Such a yield in merit and virtue brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results and leads to heavenly life, conducting to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing. Indeed, such is reckoned a great factor of immeasurable and boundless merit.</P>
<P>Just as, brethren, it is not easy to measure the water of the great ocean (saying) `there are so many measures of water, so many hundreds of measures of water, so many thousands of measures of water, so many hundreds of thousands of measures of water '-for it is reckoned as a huge, immeasurable and boundless quantity of water; likewise, brethren, the merit of the Ariyan disciple who is endowed with these four yields in merit and virtue is not easy to calculate. Such a yield in merit and virtue brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results, leads to heavenly life, conducting to good, welfare, benefit and blessing. Indeed it is reckoned as a great factor of immeasurable and boundless merit.</P>

<P>(2) Yieldt in Merit (b)</P>
<P>Brethren, there are these four yields in merit and virtue, which bring about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results and lead to heavenly life, conducting to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing. What four?</P>
<P>Brethren, herein the Ariyan disciple is endowed with perfect faith in the Exalted One thus:`He the Exalted One is an Arahant, Supremely Enlightened, full of wisdom and goodness, a Blessed One, a World-knower, a peerless Tamer of men, the Teacher of devas and men, an Awakened One, an Exalted One.' Brethren, this is the first yield in merit and virtue, which brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results and leads to heavenly life, conducing to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>
<P>Brethren, the Ariyan disciple is also endowed with perfeet faith in the Norm, thus `Well-proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm, to be realised in this life and without delay, bidding us come and see, leading us onward, to be known by the wise as a personal experience.' Brethren, this is the second yield in merit and virtue,</P>
<P>78 The Numerical Saying [TEXT ii, 57</P>
<P>which brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results, and leads to heavenly life, conducing to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>
<P>Brethren, the Ariyan disciple is also endowed with perfect ' faith in the Order, thus Well-practised is the Order of the Exalted One's disciples, also, in uprightness, method and propriety; namely, the four pairs of persons, the eight classes of individuals. Such is the Order of the Exalted One's disciples, to whom offering and duty should be done and gifts and reverent greeting given, for they are 4 the supreme field of merit in the world.' Brethren, this is the third yield in merit and virtue, which brings about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results, leads to heavenly life, conducting to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>
<P>Brethren, the Ariyan disciple is also endowed with virtues lovely to the holy Ones, unbroken and flawless, consistently practised, unblemished, making men free, commended by the wise, unperverted and conducing to rapt concentration. Brethren, this is the fourth yield in merit and virtue, which brings about happiness heavenly bliss, good results, and leads to heavenly life, conducting to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P>
<P>These indeed, brethren, are the four yields in merit and virtue, which bring about happiness, heavenly bliss, good results, and leads to heavenly life, conducing to good, welfare, benefit, delight and blessing.</P><DIR>

<P>(3) Livinq together (a)</P>
<P>At one time, the Exalted One had entered the high road between Madhura and Veranj&agrave;. Also many householders and their wives had joined the high road between Madhura and Veranj&agrave;. Then the Exalted One having left the road took a seat under a certain tree, and these householders and their wives saw the Exalted One seated under a certain tree. So seeing they came to where the Exalted One was. Having come they made obeisance to the Exalted One and sat at one side. To the householders and their wives so seated at one side the Exalted One spake thus:</P>
<P>Householders, there are these four ways of living together. What are the four? A vile man ! lives with a vile woman, a vile man lives with a goddess, a god lives with a vile woman, and a god lives with a goddess.</P>
<P>Householders, how does a vile man live with a vile woman? Herein, householders, a husband kills, steals, commits impurity, lies and indulges in fermented liquor,</P>
<P>-------</P>
<P>1. Deva&THORN;god or king and devi=goddess or queen. Chavo, `a corpse,' is here a term signifying `one contemptible'. The contrast is meant to be between the two highest degrees of mankind, chavo=out-cast, dev=king. We might say `the beggar and the nobleman'</P>

Also his wife kills, steals, commits impurity, lies, and indulges in fermented liquor, is wicked and sinful, with her heart,possessed by avarice she lives the life of the family and abuses and reviles recluses and br&agrave;hmins. Thus indeed, householders, a vile man lives with a vile woman.</P>

<P>wicked and sinful, with his heart possessed by avarice, he lives the life of a householder and abuses and reviles recluses and br&agrave;hmins. But his wife abstains from killing, thieving, sexudal impurity, lying and indulgence in fermented liquor, is virtuous and of good behaviour; with her heart freed from the taint of avarice she lives the family life and -abuses not nor reviles recluses and brahmins. Thus indeed, householders, a vile man lives with a goddess.</P>
<P>Householders, how does a god live with a vile woman? Herein, a husband abstains from killing, thieving, impurity, lying and indulgence in fermented liquor, is virtuous and of good behaviour; with his mind freed from the stains of avarice, he lives the family life and abuses not nor reviles recluses and br&agrave;hmins. But his wife kills, steals, commits impurity, lies and indulges in fermented liquor, is wicked and sinful with her heart possessed by avarice she lives the family life and abuses and reviles recluses and br&agrave;hmins. Thus indeed, householders' a god lives with a vile woman.</P>
<P>Householders, how does a god live with a goddess? Herein, a husband and a wife both abstain from killing,</P>
<P>vi. [54] On Yields in Merit 81</P>
<P>thieving, impurity, lying and indulgence in fermented liquor, are virtuous and of good behaviour; with minds freed from the taints of avarice they live the family life and abuse not nor revile recluses and br&agrave;hmins. Thus indeed, householders, a god lives with a goddess.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>These, householders, are the four ways of living together."<BR>
Both vicious,mean, abusing others, these-<BR>
Husband and wife, a vile pair linked together.<BR>
A vicious husband, mean, abusing others,<BR>
A virtuous wife, not stingy, but well-spoken-<BR>
A goddess she, paired with a partner vile.<BR>
A husband good, not stingy, but well-spoken,<BR>
A wife who's vicious, mean, abusing others-<BR>
A woman vile she's partnered with a god.<BR>
If both, believers, using loving words<BR>
One to the other, live the righteous life,<BR>
Many the blessings that attend their home.<BR>
Dejected are their foes, for both are good.<BR>
Here living by the Norm, in goodness matched,<BR>
In beaven they win the bliss that they desire.</P></DIR>

<P>(5) Happy Couple</P>
<P>At one time the Exalted One dwelt in the Deer-park of the Bhesak&agrave;la-grove at Crocodile Haunt, in the country of the Bhagg&agrave;. Now the Exalted One in the forenoon having put on His under-garment, taking bowl and outer-robe proceeded to the residence of the householder Nakula-pit&agrave; l (Nakula's father). Having arrived He sat down on the seat prepared for Him. Then both Nakula's father and mother came to where the Exalted One was. Having come they made obeisance to the Exalted One, and sat at one side. So seated the householder Nakulapit&agrave; spoke thus to the Exalted One: "Lord, ever since Nakulam&agrave;t&agrave; as a girl was brought home to me, when a youth, I know not of any misbehaviour ' on her part even by thought, much less in deed. Lord, we desire in this life to rejoice with each other and also to rejoice with each other in the next world."</P>
<P>Also the wife Nakulam&agrave;t&agrave; said thus to the Exalted One: "Lord, ever since I as a girl was taken home to Nakulapit&agrave; when a youth, I know not of any misbehaviour on his part even in thought, much less in deed. Lord, we desire in this life to rejoice with each other and also to rejoice with each other in the next world."</P>
<P>(The Master replied)" House-holders, these two, husband and wife, should indeed desire to rejoice with each other in this life and also to rejoice with each other in the next world.</P>

<P>Both should be equally faithful, equally virtuous, equally generous and equally wise. Then will they rejoice with each other not only in this life, but also in the next world."</P>
<P>(6) Husband and wife</P>
<P>Brethren,* these two, husband and wife, should indeed desire to rejoice with each other in this life as well as in the next world. They should also be equally faithful, virtuous, generous and wise and rejoice with each other in this life as well as in the next world.</P>

<P>At one time the Exalted One dwelt among the Koliyans in the Koliyan township called Sajjanelam.* Then the Exalted One in the morning having duly robed Himself, taking His alms-bowl and mantle, proceeded to the house of Suppav&agrave;s&agrave; the daughter of the Koliyans. Having arrived He sat down on the seat made ready for Him. Then indeed Suppav&agrave;s&agrave;, the daughter of the Koliyans, waiting on Him with her own hands caused Him to take His fill of excellent food both hard and soft. When the Exalted One had finished the meal and removed His hand from the bowl, Suppav&agrave;s&agrave; the daughter of the Koliyans took a seat respectfully at</P>
