Bhikkhus, the lion, king of beasts in the evening comes out of his den arouses himself, looks in the four directions, roars three times and goes in search of food. Bhikkhus, the animals who hear the lion's roar become frightened and shivering much - those living in holes enter their holes, those living in water, enter the water, those living in the forest enter the forest and birds fly away. The king's elephants securely bound in villages and hamlets, break their bonds and frightened and shivering, throw urine and excreta and run in all directions. Bhikkhus, so powerful is the lion, the king of beasts.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in like manner when the Thus Gone One is born in the world, worthy and rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, the teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed. He declares the Teaching- This is the individual, this its arising, this its cessation and this is the path to the cessation of the individual. Bhikkhus, those gods enjoying long life born into pleasantness established long, in lofty palaces, they too hearing the Teaching become anxious and frightened and think-We being impermanent thought were permanent. Not lasting forever, we thought we would last forever. We too are impermanent, changeful, do not last forever are an embodiment of an individual. Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One is so powerful and wields power over the world.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>After enlightenment, the arising and ceasing of the individual was declared to the world,<BR>
Then the released, worthy one was the incomparable teacher to gods and men.<BR>
The noble eightfold path was also declared, to overcome unpleasantness.<BR>
Hearing this, gods enjoying long life, beauty and fame were anxious and frightened<BR>
They thought we have not gone beyond a self, so we are impermanent.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>004.05. At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary, in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. The Brahmin Vassakara the chief minister of Magadha approached the Blessed One exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said to the Blessed One: Good Gotama, endowed with four things we disclose a great wise man. What four?</P>
<P>Here, Good Gotama, he is learned. His words indicate the meanings of whatever he learned and retained. He is mindfull, remembers and recalls things done and said long ago. He is clever and not lazy in the work of a layman and knows the method to do them and superintend them in the correct way. Good Gotama, endowed with these four things we disclose a great wise man. If my words are appreciated may that be so, if they are blamed, may good Gotama blame them.</P>
<P>Brahmin, I neither appreciate your words nor blame them. Brahmin, I disclose the great wise man endowed with these four things. What four?</P>
<P>Here, Brahmin, he falls to the method, for the good and pleasantness of many, establishing many in the noble method, such as building a virtuous character with good qualities. He thinks and intends, what he wants to think and intend and not what he does not want to think and intend. Thus he becomes the master over his thoughts. Of the higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now, he becomes a gainer for nothing, an easy quick gainer. Destroying desires, releasing the mind and released through wisdom, here and now he realizes and abides. Brahmin, I neither appreciate your words nor blame them. I disclose the great wise man endowed with these four things.</P>
<P>It is surprising and wonderful good Gotama, I think good Gotama is endowed with these four qualities. Here, good Gotama falls to the method, for the good and pleasantness of many, establishing many in the noble method, such as building a virtuous character with good qualities. Good Gotama thinks and intends, what he wants to think and intend and not what he does not want to think and intend. Thus good Gotama becomes the master over his thoughts. Of the higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now, good Gotama becomes a gainer for nothing, an easy quick gainer. Destroying desires, releasing the mind and released through wisdom, here and now good Gotama realizing abides.</P>
<P>Brahmin, you speak words close to praise, yet I will tell you. Here, Brahmin, I have fallen to the method, for the good and pleasantness of many, establishing many in the noble method, such as building a virtuous character with good qualities. I think and intend, what I want to think and intend and not what I do not want to think and intend. Thus I am the master over my thoughts. Of the higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now, I am a gainer for nothing, an easy quick gainer. Destroying desires, releasing the mind and released through wisdom, here and now realizing I abide.</P><DIR>

At one time the Blessed One left Ukka&ntilde;&ntilde;ha to go to Setavya and the Brahmin Dona too left Ukka&ntilde;&ntilde;ha for Setavya and both were on the way to Setavya. The Brahmin Dona saw the foot prints of the Blessed One with its thousandfold spokes, circumferences and naves, complete in every way and it occured to him: It is wonderful and surprising, these foot prints are not those of a human.</P>
<P>The Blessed One stepping out of the main road, sat at the root of a certain tree, with legs crossed, body straight and mindfulness established in front of him. The Brahmin Dona following close after the foot steps of the Blessed One, saw the Blessed One seated under a certain tree, pleasant, inspiring confidence with appeased mental faculties and appeased mind, with the highest taming and appeasement, approached the Blessed One and said: </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Good one are you a god? Brahmin, I am not a god.<BR>
Good one are you a celestial musician? Brahmin, I am not a celestial musician .<BR>
Good one are you a ghost? Brahmin, I am not a ghost<BR>

When asked good one are you a ghost, you said Brahmin I am not a ghost. When asked good one are you a human, you said Brahmin I am not a human. Then what indeed is the good one?</P>
<P>Brahmin, if the desire to be a god was not dispelled I would have become a god, it is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made palm stumps, made things that would not arise again. Brahmin, if the desire to be a celestial musician, ... re ... a ghost, ... re ... a human was not dispelled I would have become a human, it is dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made palm stumps, made things that would not arise again.</P>
<P>Brahmin, blue lotuses, white lotuses or red lotuses, born and developed in the water, come out of the water and stand untouched by the water. In the same manner Brahmin I born and bred in the world abide above it untouched by the world. Brahmin, know I am enlightened.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The desire to be a god, celestial musician, a ghost to go through the air,<BR>
A human being, or birth in an egg are shattered and destroyed.<BR>
As the lotus is not soiled by mud or water, I am not soiled by the world.<BR>
Brahmin, I am the Enlightened One.</P></DIR>

<P>Bhikkhus, to the bhikkhu there are various truths of various recluses and Brahmins: Such as the world is eternal or not eternal, the world is limited or not limited, the soul is the body or the soul is different from the body, the Thus Gone One is after death or the Thus Gone One is not after death. the Thus Gone One is and is not after death, the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death.

<P>Does good Gotama praise sacrifices?</P>
<P>Brahmin, I do not praise all sacrifices. I do not praise a sacrifice where cattle, goats, fowl pigs and other living things are destroyed. I do not praise the destruction of living creatures. What is the reason? Noble ones or those fallen to that method do not approach such sacrifices. Brahmin, I praise sacrifices where cattle, goats, fowl pigs and other living things are not destroyed. I praise the non destruction of living creatures, such as a constant source of giving gifts and making suitable sacrifices. What is the reason?
