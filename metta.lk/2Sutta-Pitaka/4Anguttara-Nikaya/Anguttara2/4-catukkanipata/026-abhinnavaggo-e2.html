ON HIGHER KNOWLEDGE</P>
</B><EM><P>(1) Higher Knowledge</P>
</EM><P>BRETHREN, there are these four things. What four? Things to be known by higher knowledge, things to be rejected by higher knowledge, things to be developed by higher knowledge, and things to be realised by higher knowledge.</P>
<P>And what, brethren, are the things to be known by higher knowledge? The factors of the fivefold grasping.</P>
<P>And what, brethren, are the things to be rejected by higher knowledge? Ignorance and craving for existence.</P>
<P>And what, brethren, are the things to be developed by higher knowledge? Quietude and insight.</P>
<P>And what, brethren, are the things to be realised by higher knowledge? Wisdom and emancipation.</P>
<P>These, brethren, are the four things.</P>
<P>(2) Quests</P>
<P>Brethren, there are these four un-Ariyan quests. What four?</P>
<P>xxvi. Section 252] On <EM>Higher Knowledge </EM>311</P>
<P>Herein, brethren, a certain one, being himself subject to growing old, seeks after growing old; himself subject to disease, seeks after disease; himself subject to death, seeks after death; himself subject to the depravities, seeks after them. These are the four quests that are un-Ariyan.</P>
<P>Brethren, there are these four Ariyan quests. What four?</P>
<P>Herein, a certain one, himself subject to growing old and seeing loss therein, seeks for the imperishable, incomparable security of Nibb&agrave;na: himself subject to disease and seeing loss therein, he seeks for the wholly sane, incomparable security of Nibb&agrave;na: himself subject to death and seeing loss therein, he seeks after the deathless, incomparable security of Nibb&agrave;na himself subject to the depravities and seeing loss therein, he seeks the untainted, incomparable security of Nibb&agrave;na. These are the four Ariyan quests.</P>
<EM><P>(3) Popularity</P>
</EM><P>Brethren, there are these four grounds for popularity. What four? Liberality, kindly speech, helpful conduct and being on equal terms. These are the four.</P>
<EM><P>(4) Instruction in Brief*2</P>
</EM><P>Once the venerable M&agrave;lunkyaputta* came to the Exalted One ... and said: </P>
<EM><P>-----------</P>
<P>1 </EM>Of. Chapter 4. 2 (above) , where it is given in g&agrave;th&agrave;s.</P>
<P>2 Also at S. <EM>N. </EM>IV, 72.</P>
<P>3 Son of the br&agrave;hmin woman M&agrave;lunkiya. The name is often written M&agrave;lukiy&agrave;..</P>
<P>312 <EM>The Numerical Sayings </EM>[T.EXT ii, 248</P>
<P>&szlig;Good were it, Lord, if the Exalted One declare to me the Norm in brief, so that, having heard the Norm from the Exalted One, I may abide alone, secluded, earnest, zealous and master of myself.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Now herein, M&agrave;lunkyaputta, what is the use of my teaching young brothers, if (as in your case) when you are old, decrepit and aged, you ask the Accomplished One for instruction in brief?&ucirc; *</P>
<P>&szlig;Lord, may the Exalted One declare to me the Norm in brief, may the Blessed One declare the Norm in brief. Good if I know the meaning of the Exalted One's word. Good indeed if I become an heir to the Exalted One's word.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Now, M&agrave;lunkyaputta, there are these four grounds for the arising of craving, whence craving usually arises in the mind of a brother. What four? Craving arises in the mind of a brother owing to robes, alms-food and so forth, and owing to eternalist or annihilationist views. Verily, M&agrave;lunkyaputta, there are these four grounds for the arising of craving ... </P>
<P>But verily, M&agrave;lunkyaputta, whenever in a brother craving has been abandoned and cut off at the root like a palm tree with its base destroyed, rendered unable to sprout out again, then such a brother is said to have destroyed craving, broken the fetters, and by full understanding of false pride is said to have ended sorrow.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then the venerable M&agrave;lunkyaputta, thus exhorted by the Exalted One with this instruction, rose from his seat, made</P>
<P>------------</P>
<P>1 The Master said this (according to Comy) to depreciate the old thera and to encourage him. It is also said that in his youth he had neglected the detailed teaching and fallen back. Now he asks for a comprehensive view of it.</P>
<P>xxvi. Section 255] On <EM>Higher Knowledge</EM> 313</P>
<P>obeisance, walked round the Exalted One by the right and departed thence.</P>
<P>Thereafter the venerable M&agrave;lunkyaputta, abiding alone, secluded, earnest, zealous and master of himself, even in a short time, having himself for himself in this life itself realised. it, dwelt in the incomparable perfection of the religious life, to win which clansmen duly wander forth from the home to the homeless life. Having conquered birth, led the holy life and done that which was to be done, he realised there was no more existence for him beyond this life.* Thus did the venerable M&agrave;lunkyaputta become yet another of the Arahants of the Exalted One.</P>
<EM><P>(5) Prosperity</P>
</EM><P>Brethren, whatever families attain to greatness in wealth, all of them do not last for long owing to four causes or one of four. Owing to what four?</P>

Brethren, whatever families attain to greatness in wealth, indeed all of them do not last for long owing to these four causes or one of them.</P>
