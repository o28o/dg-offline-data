</FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>003.01. At one time the Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there:</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, at one time before enlightenment, I was living in this Ajapala grove, on the bank of river Neranjara in this same Uruwela. When I was in seclusion this thought occured to me: It is unpleasant to live in disrespect, without order, what if I live treating with respect and honouring, a recluse or brahmin. Then it occured to me, for the completion of my incomplete virtues, I should live, treating with respect and honouring some other recluse or brahmin. In this world, together with its gods and men, M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins, I do not see anyone more virtuous than me to treat with respect and to honour. For the completion of my incomplete concentration, I should live, treating with respect and honouring some other recluse or brahmin. In this world, together with its gods and men, M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins, I do not see anyone more concentrated than me to treat with respect and to honour. For the completion of my incomplete wisdom, I should live, treating with respect and honouring some other recluse or brahmin. In this world, together with its gods and men, M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins, I do not see anyone more wise than me to treat with respect and to honour. For the completion of my incomplete release, I should live, treating with respect and honouring some other recluse or brahmin. In this world, together with its gods and men, M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins, I do not see anyone so well released like me to treat with respect and to honour</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, then it occured to me: What if I treat with respect and honour the Teaching realized by me and abide? Brahma Sahampati cognizing my thought process in his mind, as though a powerful man would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm, disappeared from the world of Brahma and appeared before me.</P>
<P>Brahma Sahampati arranging his shawl on one shoulder and putting down his right knee and clasping his hands towards me said:</P>
<P>O! Blessed One, O! Well Gone One, it should be so! Venerable sir, those rightfully enlightened ones in the past abode treating with respect and honouring the Teaching. Those rightfully enlightened ones to come in the future too will abide treating with respect and honouring the Teaching. Now too, the Blessed One, rightfully enlightened should abide treating with respect and honouring the Teaching. Brahma Sahampati further said:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The Enlightened Ones that passed away and those to come in the future<BR>
And the rightfully Enlightened One at present, destroyers of much unpleasantness<BR>
Lived honouring the good Teaching and also should do so at present.<BR>
In the future they will do it, it is the rightful order of things.<BR>
Therefore those who love themselves, should constantly honour<BR>
The Teaching recalling the dispensation of the enlightened ones.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Saying this Brahma Sahampati worshipped the Blessed One, circumambulated him and disappeared from there. Bhikkhus, I knowing Brahma's entreaty and the suitable for me abode treating with respect and honouring the Teaching, so that the Community should be endowed with greatness and much respect.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">2. Dutiyauruwelasutta&uuml; &Yacute; The second in Uruwela</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>003.02. Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, I was living in the Ajapala grove on the bank of river Neranjara in Uruwela. Then many aged brahmins, decayed and reached the end of life, approached me, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said: Good Gotama, we have heard that the recluse Gotama does not salute, attend or offer a seat to aged brahmins, decayed and reached the end of life. Good Gotama, that is not the right conduct</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, then it occured to me: These venerable ones do not know the elder or the attributes of an elder.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there may be elders of eighty years, ninety years or even a hundred years from birth, talking, at the improper time, not the real and the not essential. Talk that is not the Teaching and the discipline, words without a limit and location and could not be treasured. They go to the category of foolish elders.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there may be the young in the prime of life with black hair talking, at the proper time, talking the real and the essential. Talking about the Teaching and the discipline, words with a limit and location and could be treasured. They go to the category of wise elders.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these four are the attributes of an elder. What four?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is virtuous restrained in the higher code of rules, pursuing the right course of conduct sees fear in the slightest fault and observes the precepts to train. He becomes learned and bears and treasures what he has learned. The Teaching good at the beginning, middle and the end full of meaning even in the letter explaining the pure and complete holy life. Of such a Teaching he becomes learned, bearing it in words, relaying it in mind and penetrating it to realize. He becomes a gainer for nothing, a gainer without difficulty, a quick gainer of the four higher states of mind, the pleasant abidings here and now. Desroying desires, releasing the mind from desires and released through wisdom, abides here and now having re&agrave;lized. Bhikkhus, these four are the attributes of an elder.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>If someone is puffed up, talks much, frivolously<BR>
With undisciplined thoughts like an animal<BR>
Unkind with evil thoughts he is far from stability.<BR>
If someone is virtuous, learned and intelligent,<BR>
Wants to perceive the Teaching wisely<BR>
Has gone beyond all things unobstructed and is intelligent,<BR>
Has dispelled birth and death and gone to the end of the holy life<BR>
He is the elder without desires, I call him an elder.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>003.03. Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One is thoroughly enlightened about the world. The Thus Gone One is disentangled from the world. Is enlightened about the arising of the world and has dispelled it, the cessation of the world and has realized it and the path leading to the cessation of the world and has developed it.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One is enlightened about all the seen, heard, experienced, cognized, wished for and pursued by the mind by gods and men together with M&agrave;ra, brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins. Therefore it is said I am Thus Gone.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, from the moment of my enlightenment until I pass into final extinction, whatever I said, muttered and pointed out, is that same, not another, therefore I am Thus Gone, it is said.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, as the Thus Gone One says, so he does, as he does, so he says, because he does what he says and says what he does, therefore he is Thus Gone, it is said.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, to this world, together with gods and men, M&agrave;ra, Brahma, the Community of recluses and brahmins, the Thus Gone One is the unconquered Lord, the all pervading one, the controller of all, therefore he is Thus Gone, it is said.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Realizing the whole world as it really is, disentangled from all the world,<BR>
Released from all bonds experiences the bliss of extinction<BR>
Desires destroyed, enlightened and doubts dispelled<BR>
Has destroyed all actions, is released without holding anything<BR>
That is the enlightened noble lion, who rolls the wheel of the Teaching<BR>
Gods and men who have taken refuge in enlightenment,<BR>
Get together and worship you as they have always done<BR>
Tamed, you are the chief to tame, appeased, the sage to appease<BR>
Released, is the foremost to release, and crossed you cross others<BR>
We always worship you, there is no compare to you in this world of gods and men.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>003.04. At one time the Blessed One was living in Kalaka's monastery in saketa and the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. Bhikkhus, I thoroughly know whatever seen, heard, experienced, cognized and pursued by the mind, in the world of gods and men, M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins. I do not care for them. Bhikkhus, if I said, I know whatever seen, heard, experienced, cognized and pursued by the mind, of the world of gods and men, M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the community of recluses and brahmins, it will be a lie. If I said, I know and do not know them, it would also be a lie. If I said, I neither know nor not that I do not know, it would be an unqualified statement. Therefore bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One seeing, does not think a should be seen was seen, or think it was not seen. Does not think of a should be seen or of one who has seen. Hearing, does not think a should be heard was heard, or think it was not heard. Does not think of a should be heard or of one who has heard. Experiencing, does not think a should be experienced was experienced, or think it was not experienced. Does not think of a should be experienced or of one who has experienced. Cognizing, does not think a should be cognized was cognized, or think it was not cognized. Does not think of a should be cognized or of one who has cognized.</P>
<P>Thus, bhikkhus, the Thus Gone One is such like in things seen, heard, experinced and cognized, he is highly qualified in those things and there is not a more noble and exalted state evident, it is said.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Whatever seen, heard, or experienced is true to those clinging to them<BR>
And false to the outsider, these are not to the self restrained.<BR>
True and false is an external assumption, the populace is entangled in,<BR>
Seeing the remedy for this<BR>
Thus Gone Ones have no clingings as I know and I see.</P></DIR>

<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is satisfied with whatever gain of robes. He does not talk in praise of this and other kind of robe, with words improper and unsuitable.
