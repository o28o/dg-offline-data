</EM><P>(11) Lust</P>
<P>Brethren, for the purpose of comprehending lust, four things must be developed. What four?</P>
<P>Herein, brethren, let a brother, as to body, continue so to look upon body that he remains ardent, self-possessed and mindful, having overcome both the hankering and the dejection common in the world. And in the same way as to feelings, thoughts and ideas, let him so look upon each, that he remains ardent, self-possessed and mindful, having overcome both the hankering and the dejection common in the world.*</P>
<P>Brethren, for the purpose of comprehending lust, four (other) things must be developed. What four?</P>
<P>Herein, brethren, a brother produces a desire, strives, makes an effort, applies and exerts his mind to prevent the arising of evil and sinful conditions that have not yet arisen; so does he strive to put away evil and sinful conditions that have arisen; for the coming into existence of good and virtuous conditions that have not arisen; for the continuance of good and virtuous conditions that have arisen, for the absence of confusion, for the growth,</P>

<P>development and fulfilment of meditation he produces a desire, strives, makes an effort, applies and exerts himself. Brethren, for the purpose of comprehending lust these four things must be developed.</P>
<P>Brethren, for the purpose of comprehending lust these four (other) things must be developed. What four?</P>
<P>Herein, a brother develops the four bases of psychic powers,* to wit: the making determination in respect of concentration on purpose, on will, on thoughts and on investigation. Brethren, for the purpose of comprehending lust these four things must be developed.</P>
<P>Brethren, for the purpose of well understanding, for the ending, the putting away, the extinction, the passing away, the detachment and cessation from, the forsaking and renunciation of lust,--these four things must be developed.</P>
<P>For the purpose of comprehending, understanding, ending ... ignorance, hatred, enmity, ill-feeling malice, envy, avarice,* deceit, craft, hypocrisy, pride, arrogance, conceit and negligence-these four things must be developed.'</P>
