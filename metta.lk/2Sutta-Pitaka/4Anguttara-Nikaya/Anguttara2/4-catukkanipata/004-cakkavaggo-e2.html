<P>(1) Blessings</P>
<P>0 BRETHREN, there are these four Blessings.* Whosoever is endowed with this lucky tetrad, among either gods or men, ere long attains to fullness and greatness in worldly possessions. What are the four?</P>
<P>To live in a suitable country, to associate with good and righteous people, to possess a rightly-resolved mind, and to have done good deeds in a former life. Indeed, brethren, whosoever among devas and men is endowed with this lucky tetrad ere long attains to fullness and greatness in worldly possessions.</P><DIR>

With goodly friends around,<BR>

Four things result from this:<BR>
Wealth from the crops, good name,<BR>
Good fame and happiness.</P></DIR>

<P>(2) Kindly Feeling</P>
<P>0 brethren, there are these four bases of kindly feeling.* What are the four? Liberality, pleasant words, doing a good turn, and equal treatment.* These indeed, brethren, are the four bases of kindly feeling.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>A generous hand, kind words, doing good turns,<BR>
Being on equal terms in season due&Yacute;<BR>
Such acts of kindly feeling in this world<BR>
Are like the linch-pin of a moving car.<BR>
But if those acts be wanting, mother who bore<BR>
And father who begat will not receive<BR>
The honour and respect that are their due.<BR>
Wherever wise men fear these acts in mind,<BR>
They win great influence, and praise is theirs</P></DIR>

<P>(3) The Lion</P>
<P>0brethren, the lion,* king of beasts, at eventide comes forth from his lair. Having so come forth he shakes off sluggishness. Having so done he looks around in the four directions. Then he roars thrice. Having so roared he</P>

<P>goes forth in search of food. And then, brethren, whatsoever animals hear the roar of the lion, king of beasts, they tremble with exceeding fear, terror and alarm. Animals living in holes flee to their holes, aquatic animals rush into the water. Those living in the jungles run away to the jungles. Birds fly into the sky. Brethren, even the royal elephants, whether in village, market-town or royal city, well-secured with strong ropes, do split and break their bonds, and stricken with fear begin to void their excrements and flee wheresoever they can flee. Brethren, the lion, king of beasts, is therefore the lord of animals and is possessed of great majesty.</P>
<P>In the self-same way, brethren, when an Accomplished One appears in the world, an Exalted One, a Supremely Enlightened One, Perfect in knowledge and conduct, an Auspicious One, a Knower of all the worlds, an Incomparable One, a Teacher of devas and men, an Awakened One, a Blessed One&THORN;He thus proclaims the Norm: &szlig;Thus is body-bood,&ucirc; thus is the arising of body-hood, thus is the ceasing of body-hood and thus is the path leading to the cessation of body-hood.'</P>
<P>Brethren, whatsoever devas are long-lived, of comely appearance, enjoying much happiness and in long possession of splendid mansions, when they hear the Norm declared by the Accomplished One, they become stricken with exceeding fear, terror and alarm (and exclaim):&ucirc; Of a truth, friends, being impermanent we fancied ourselves permanent: being unstable we fancied ourselves stable, and being temporary we fancied ourselves eternal. Indeed, friends, we are confined by body-hood, which is impermanent,</P>

<P>whether with two or four, many feet or without feet, with or without form, with or without perception, with neither perception nor non-perception, the Accomplished One, the Exalted Buddha Supreme, is proclaimed to be the most excellent. Brethren, whoso has faith in the Buddha has the best faith. He indeed, who has this best faith, gains the highest result.</P>
<P>Brethren, whatsoever teachings there are relating to conditioned things, the Noble Eightfold Path is the most excellent among them. Brethren, whoso has faith in the Norm has the best faith. He indeed who has this best of faiths gains the highest result.</P>
<P>Brethren, whatsoever teachings there are relating to things conditioned or unconditioned, of them all dispassion wliich conquers sensuality, allays thirst, uproots cleaving, breaks the circle of repeated births, destroys craving and leads to cessation and Nibbana, is the most excellent. Brothren, whose has faith in the Norm has the best faith. He, indeed, who has this best of faiths gains the best result.</P>
<P>Brethren, whatsoever fraternities or bodies there are, of them all most excellent in truth is the Order of the Disciples of the Accomplished One, consisting of the four pairs of persons, the eight classes of individuals, well-practised in uprightness, method and propriety, to whom offerings and ministering should be given and gifts and reverent greeting rendered, as unto the supreme field of merit throughout the world. Whose, brethren, has faith in the order, has the best faith. He indeed who has the best of faiths gains the highest result.</P>

He is possessed of good memory, remembers and well recollects what has been done and said long ago. Whatsoever house-holder's duties there be, he is skilled and diligent therein and is endowed with a sense of discrimination in what should be done and ordered to be done.

<P>(6) Not a Man</P>
<P>At one time, the Exalted One had reached the highroad between (the two towns of) Ukkattha and Setabbya. Then the brahmin named Dona had also reached the highroad between Ukkattha and Setabbya. Now Dona the br&agrave;hmin saw the marks of the discs on the feet of the Exalted One, consisting of a thousand spokes, with tyres and hubs, complete in all respects. So seeing, this thought occurred to him How wonderful indeed and marvellous! Verily these cannot be the feet of a human being.'</P>
<P>Just then the Exalted One left the road and sat down at the foot of a tree cross-legged, with body erect and mindfulness well-established. Then Dona the br&agrave;hmin, following the footsteps of the Exalted One, saw Him seated at the foot of that tree resplendent and of a comely appearance, with senses controlled, with mind appeased, supremely tamed, restrained, and powerful. So seeing he approached where the Exalted One was. Having come he said thus to Him;</P>

<P>(7) Safe from falling away</P>
<P>Brethren, a brother who is endowed with four qualities is safe against falling away and is near unto Nibbana. With what four?</P>
<P>Brethren, herein a brother leads a virtuous life, his sense-doors are well-guarded, he observes moderation in eating and is devoted to vigilance.</P>
<P>Brethren, how does a brother lead a virtuous life? Brethren, herein a brother is virtuous, dwells in the observance of Patimokkha rules, observes good manners and right behaviour, fears even venial sins, and having taken the precepts practises them. Thus indeed, brethren, a brother leads a virtuous life.</P>

<P>eye, is not entranced by the general appearance nor taken up with the details thereof; by reason of what? Because evil thoughts such as covetousness and ill-will attack him who dwells with the sense of sight uncontrolled. He practises control and guards the sense of sight and attains to restraint of the sense of sight.</P>
<P>Having heard a sound with the car, smelt an odour with the nose, tasted a savour with the tongue, felt a touch with the body and conceived a thought with the mind, he is not entranced by the general qualities nor taken up with the details thereof; by reason of what? Because evil thoughts such as covetousness and ill-will attack him who dwells with mind uncontrolled. He practises control and guards the mind and attains to restraint of the mind. Thus indeed, brethren, does a brother guard the doors of the senses.</P>
<P>Brethren, how does a brother observe moderation in eating? Brethren, here a brother takes food with mind fully awake, not for the purpose of sport, lust, adornment or beauty, but, so long as life lasts, with a view to nourishment, satisfying, hunger, and as an aid to leading the holy life; also (thinking to himself)'thus shall I get rid of old pain and not create new pain. I shall pass my time harmlessly and dwell at case.' Thus indeed, brethren, does a brother observe moderation in eating.</P>
<P>Brethren, how does a brother practise vigilance? Herein a brother in the daytime, whilst walking up and down or sitting down, cleanses his mind of the obstructive causes. During the first watch of the night, whilst walking up and down or sitting down, he cleanses his mind of the obstructive causes. During the middle watch of the night, placing one foot upon the other foot, he lies down on his right side in</P>
<P>1v [37] On Blessings 57</P>
<P>noble repose, mindful and recollected, with a fixed intention to rise (at a particular time) . During the last watch of the night, having risen up, whilst walking up and down or sitting down, he cleanses his mind of the obstructive causes. Thus indeed, brethren, a brother practises vigilance.</P>
<P>Brethren, a brother who is endowed with these four qualities is safe from falling away and is near Nibbana.</P><DIR>

<P>In virtue established, with his senses trained,<BR>
Keeping the mean in food, and wide-awake,<BR>

<P>Brethren, how does a brother become one who is freed from individual beliefs? Herein, brethren, if a brother entertain any individual beliefs held by many recluses and br&agrave;hmins, such as, `the world is eternal or not eternal,' `the world is finite or infinite,' `life is the same as body,' or life is one thing and body is another thing,' `the Accomplished One' exists after death or does not exist after death,' `the Accomplished One both exists and does not exist after death,' `the Accomplished One neither</P>

<P>Brethren, how does a brother become one who has done with all foolish longings? 1 Brethren, herein a brother has given up all longing for sensual pleasures, has given up longing for continued existence and has ended the desire for the holy life.* Thus indeed, brethren, is a,brother one who has done with all foolish longings.</P>
<P>Brethren, how does a brother become one whose body complex is calmed *? Brethren, a brother has given up happiness, has given up pain, has ended happiness and pain in the past also, and having perfected equanimity (which is removed alike from both happiness and pain) and mindfulness, he dwells having attained the Fourth Ecstasy. Thus indeed, brethren, is a brother one whose bodycomplex is calmed.</P>
<P>Brethren, how does a brother become a solitary one? Brethren, a brother has destroyed egoism, with roots cut out, like a palm tree with its base destroyed and rendered unable to sprout again, so that in future it does not again come into existence. Thus indeed, brethren, does a brother become a solitary one.</P>

<P>Indeed, br&agrave;hmin, I do not speak highly of all oblations. Neither do I, br&agrave;hmin, speak disparagingly of all oblations. In whatsoever oblations oxen are slaughtered, goats, sheep, fowls, and pigs are killed and other sorts of animals come to destruction, indeed, br&agrave;hmin, I do not speak highly of such wrongful oblations.
