<P>Here, bhikkhus, a concentration developed and made much conduces to a pleasant abiding here and now. A concentration developed and made much conduces to gain of knowledge and vision. A concentration developed and made much conduces to mindfull awareness. and a concentration developed and made much conduces to the destruction of desires.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the concentration developed and made much would conduce to a pleasant abiding here and now?.</P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the bhikkhu secluding the mind from sensual desires ... re ... attains to the fourth higher state of mind. Bhikkhus, this concentration developed and made much would conduce to a pleasant abiding here and now.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the concentration developed and made much would conduce to a gain of knowledge and vision?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu attends to the perception of light and intends the perception of daylight. In the day time, intends night and in the night, intends day. Thus with an open mind develops the uncovered mind, full of light.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this concentration developed and made much would conduce to a gain of knowledge and vision.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the concentration developed and made much would conduce to mindfull awareness?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, to the bhikkhu feelings arise, persist and fade knowingly,. perceptions arise, persist and fade knowingly and thoughts arise, persist and fade knowingly.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, this concentration developed and made much conduces to mindfull awareness.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what concentration developed and made much would conduce to the destructin of desires?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides reflecting the arising and fading of the five holdling masses. This is matter, this its arising and this its fading. This is feeling, this its arising and this its fading. This is perception, this its arising and this its fading. These are determinations, this its arising and this its fading. This is consciousness, this its arising and this its fading. Bhikkhus, these four are the developments of concentration. On account of this it was stated as follows in the Parayana Vagga in reply to Pu&otilde;&otilde;a's quest.</P>
<P>Discriminatingly considering this world and the beyond, not seeing any vacillations,</P>
<P>I say he has crossed over, is appeased, emancipated and without desires.</P>

<P>Venerable sir, is it possible to know, see or achieve that state which has no birth, decay, death, disappearing and appearing by going to the end of the world?</P>
<P>Friend, I do not say that the state that has no birth, decay, death, disappearing and appearing could be known, seen or achieved by going to the end of the world.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, it is wonderful and surprising, these good words of the Blessed One. Friend, I do not say that the state that has no birth, decay, death, disappearing and appearing could be known, seen or achieved by going to the end of the world. Venerable sir, in the past there was a sage, the son of a villager, with psychic powers to go through the air. Venerable sir, then I had such a speed, a trained, proficient archer, with deft hands, would put down a standing palm in a very short time and without difficulty, such was my speed. Venerable sir my stride was such, putting one foot on the eastern ocean the other I put on the western ocean. Endowed with that speed and that stride, this desire arose to me. I will reach the end of the world. I travelled for a hundred years, through out my life span stopping only to eat, drink taste and enjoy. For urinating, excreting, to expel sleepiness and exhaustion and not coming to the end of the world I died on the way.
