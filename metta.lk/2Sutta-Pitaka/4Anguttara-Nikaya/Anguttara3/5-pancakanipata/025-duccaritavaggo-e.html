<P>It is impure, has evil smells, it is with fear, it is the dwelling of troublesome non-humans, it is the wailing place for many. Bhikkhus, these five are the dangers of a cemetery.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner these are the five dangers of a person comparable to a cemetery. What five?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person is endowed with impure bodily, verbal and mental activity. This I say, is his impurity. Bhikkhus, just as that cemetery is impure, so also is this person.</P>
<P>Ill fame spreads of that person who has impure bodily, verbal and mental activity. This I say, is his evil smell. As the cemetery smells, so too this person.</P>
<P>The well behaved bhikkhus avoid this one endowed with impure bodily, verbal and mental activities from a distance, to that I say he is with fear. As the cemetery is with fear, so also this person.</P>
<P>This person with impure bodily, verbal and mental activity associates a person, of the same category. This I say, is the troublesome living together. As the cemetery is dwelling of troublesome non-humans, so also this person's dwelling.</P>
<P>The well behaved bhikkhus, seeing this person with impure bodily, verbal and mental activities turn away from him -thinking O! it is unpleasant to live with such a person. That I say, is the wailing. Bhikkhus, just as the cemetery is the wailing place of many, so also is this person. Bhikkhus, these five are the dangers of a person comparable to a cemetery.</P>

Then it occurs to him: That person favoured by us, is suspended by the Community. Displeasure arises among the bhikkhus and they do not associate other bhikkhus. As a result they do not hear the Teaching and they deteriorate in the Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the first danger in favouring a person ... </P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, if a certain person is favoured by a person he falls to a certain ecclesiastical offence, on account of which the Community makes him sit at the end.

As a result they do not hear the Teaching and they deteriorate in the Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the second danger in favouring a person.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, if a certain person is favoured by a person and he becomes unsteady, ... re ... confused in mind, ... re ... or dies&ograve;hen it occurs: That person favoured by us, has died.
