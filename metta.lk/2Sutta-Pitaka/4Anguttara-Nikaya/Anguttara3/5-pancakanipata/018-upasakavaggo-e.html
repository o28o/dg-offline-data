<P>Controlled in these five precepts there is a guarding of activities.</P>
<P>What are the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained for nothing, quickly and easily?</P>
<P>Here, S&agrave;riputta, the noble disciple is endowed with unwavering faith in The Blessed One: That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct well gone, knower of the worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.

<DIR>

<P>Knowing the noble teaching and fearing hell,<BR>
The wise avoid demerit, not hurting living things knowingly,<BR>
Not telling lies, nor touching others' belongings<BR>
Happy with one's wife not delighting in others' wives<BR>
Avoiding intoxicants that delude the mind,<BR>
Recalling the good Teaching, they think discursively about it.<BR>
With a non angry mind they develop heavenly bliss<BR>
Giving gifts with careful attention, they acquire merit.<BR>
The first gifts given to the appeased bring good results.<BR>
S&agrave;riputta, I will tell about the appeased. Listen!<BR>
Of the dark and white things carried away by Rohinie,<BR>
There are cattle that are spotted, beautiful and dove coloured.<BR>
Of them the young tamed ones are the best.<BR>
They are powerful, can bear the load and have speed.<BR>
Their colour does not matter, the load is given to them.<BR>
In the same manner those born human, wherever they are born<BR>
As warriors, Brahmins, ordinary or outcastes<BR>
Of them the tamed, gentle are the best<BR>
Righteous, virtuous, truthful and shameful,<BR>
Having dispelled birth and death and done the duties of the holy life<BR>
Unyoked from the load are without desires.<BR>
Gone beyond all things are extinguished without desires.<BR>
Gifts given in that field are full of results.<BR>
The foolish not learned attend outside this field.<BR>
They that attend on the appeased, wise,<BR>
Get their roots of faith well established in the well gone one.<BR>
They are either born in heaven, or in a high clan here<BR>
And those wise gradually reach extinction.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>018.10. At one time The Blessed One was touring the country of Kosala with a large Community of bhikkhus. On the way seeing a certain Sala forest the Blessd One deviating from the path entered that Sala forest and reaching a certain place smiled.</P>
<P>It occurred to venerable &acirc;nanda: What is the reason that The Blessed One should smile?</P>
<P>Without a reason Thus gone Ones do not smile. Then venerable &acirc;nanda said to The Blessed One; - Venerable sir, what is the reason for The Blessed One to smile. Thus Gone Ones do not smile without a reason?</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, in the past, in this place there was a prosperous and populated city. The Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and rightfully enlightened abode relying on that city. There was a lay disciple named, Gavesi incomplete in virtues, to The Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and rightfully enlightened. The lay disciple Gavesi was advising about five hundred other lay disciples, who were also incomplete in virtues. Then it occurred to Gavesi the lay disciple: I have been of much help to these five hundred lay disciples. Of them I am the foremost. I am incomplete in my virtues, so also these five hundred lay disciples. We are on equal grounds, there is no super quality in me; how could I be superior.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, then the lay disciple Gavesi approached the five hundred lay disciples and said: Friends, from today know me as complete in my virtues.</P>
<P>Then it occurred to those five hundred lay disciples: Our master Gavesi has been of great help to us, advising us. He is going to be complete in virtues. Why shouldn't we. Then the five hundred lay disciples approached the lay disciple Gavesi and said: Master Gavesi, from today these five hundred lay disciples will be complete in virtues. Then it occurred to Gavesi the lay disciple: I have been of much help to these five hundred lay disciples. Of them I am the foremost. I am complete in my virtues, so also these five hundred lay disciples. We are on equal grounds, there is no super quality in me; how could I be superior.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, then the lay disciple Gavesi approached the five hundred lay disciples and said: Friends, from today I will give up low behaviour and sexual intercourse.</P>
<P>Then it occurred to those five hundred lay disciples: Our master Gavesi has been of great help to us, advising us. He will give up low behaviour and sexual intercourse. Why shouldn't we. Then the five hundred lay disciples approached the lay disciple Gavesi and said: Master Gavesi, from today these five hundred lay disciples will give up low behaviour and sexual intercourse. Then it occurred to Gavesi the lay disciple: I have been of much help to these five hundred lay disciples. Of them I am the foremost. I am complete in my virtues, so also these five hundred lay disciples. I lead a holy life away from low sexual intercourse. These five hundred lay disciples too lead a holy life away from low sexual intercourse. We are on equal grounds, there is no super quality in me; how could I be superior.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, then the lay disciple Gavesi approached the five hundred lay disciples and said: Friends, from today I will abide on one meal, refraining from food at night and untimely hours.</P>
<P>Then it occurred to those five hundred lay disciples: Our master Gavesi has been of great help to us, advising us. He is going to abide on one meal per day refraining from food at night and untimely hours. Why shouldn't we. Then the five hundred lay disciples approached the lay disciple Gavesi and said: Master Gavesi, from today these five hundred lay disciples will abide on one meal per day refraining from food at night and untimely hours. Then it occurred to Gavesi the lay disciple: I have been of much help to these five hundred lay disciples. Of them I am the foremost. I am complete in my virtues, so also these five hundred lay disciples. I lead a holy life away from low sexual intercourse, so too these five hundred lay disciples. I abide on one meal per day refraining from food at night and untimely hours. We are on equal grounds, there is no super quality in me; how could I be superior.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, then the lay disciple Gavesi approached The Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and rightfully enlightened and said: Venerable sir, may I gain the going forth and the higher ordination in the presence of The Blessed One. Then &acirc;nanda, the lay disciple Gavesi gained the going forth and the higher ordination in the presence of The Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and rightfully enlightened. Soon after his higher ordination, withdrawn from the crowd and secluded abiding with aroused effort to dispel, he attained the noble aim for which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless.</P>
<P>He here and now knowing realized the end of the holy life and abode. He thoroughly knew birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, what should be done is done, there is nothing to wish. &acirc;nanda, Gavesi became one of the arahants.</P>
<P>Then, &acirc;nanda, to those five hundred lay disciples it occurred: Our master Gavesi has been of great help to us, advising us. He has shaved head and beard, wearing yellow robes has gone forth and become homeless Why shouldn't we. Then the five hundred lay disciples approached The Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and rightfully enlightened and said: Venerable sir, may we gain the going forth and the higher ordination in the presence of The Blessed One. Then &acirc;nanda, the five hundred lay disciples gained the going forth and the higher ordination in the presence of The Blessed One Kassapa, worthy and rightfully enlightened.</P>
<P>Then, &acirc;nanda, to the bhikkhu Gavesi it occurred: I am a gainer for nothing, a quick and easy gainer of the pleasantness of release. Oh! these five hundred bhikkhus too should be gainers for nothing, quick and easy gainers of the pleasantness of release. Then &acirc;nanda, those five hundred bhikkhus, withdrawn from the crowd and secluded, abiding with aroused effort to dispel, attained the noble aim for which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless.</P>
<P>They here and now knowing realized the end of the holy life and abode. They thoroughly knew birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, what should be done is done, there is nothing to wish.</P>
<P>Thus &acirc;nanda, those five hundred bhikkhus headed by the bhikkhu Gavesi realized the noble release by putting forth effort. &acirc;nanda, you should train thus: We should realize noble release, by putting forth more and more exalted effort.</P>
