If it is shaken or disturbed, it will not be drinkable. What if I go down on my fours, drink like cattle and go away. Then he goes down on his fours and drinks the water in the cattle rut and goes away. In the same manner friends, it is like that person with impure bodily behaviour, impure verbal behaviour, from time to time gaining a rare purity, a brightness. At such times his impure bodily behaviour should not be thought of, his impure verbal behaviour should not be thought of. The rare gain of purity and brightness that rises from time to time should be thought of &ograve;he hurtfulness towards that person should be repressed in this manner ... </P>
