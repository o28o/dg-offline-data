</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>010.10. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in Gosita's monastery in Kosambi. At that time a son of the Koliyas named Kakudha attended on venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na and he had passed away recently. He was reborn as a spiritual being in the form of two or three Magadhan farmers in a field. With that spiritual form he does not trouble himself or others.</P>
<P>Kakudha the son of gods approached venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na, worshipped and stood on a side and said to venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na: This desire arose to Devadatta. `I will conduct the Community of bhikkhus. ' Venerable sir, as soon as that desire arose to him his psychic powers vanished. Saying this Kakudha the son of the gods worshipped venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na, circumambulated him and vanished. Then venerable ManaMoggall&agrave;na approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side and said to The Blessed One: Venerable sir, the son of the Koliyas named Kakudha who attended on me passed away recently. He was reborn as a spiritual being in the form of two or three Magadhan farmers in a field. With that spiritual form he does not trouble himself or others.</P>

Moggall&agrave;na, have you penetrated and seen the mind of Kakudha, the son of the gods with your mind, and are his words the truth or is it different? &szlig; Venerable sir, I have penetrated and seen the mind of Kakudha the son of the gods, and his words are real and not false.</P>
