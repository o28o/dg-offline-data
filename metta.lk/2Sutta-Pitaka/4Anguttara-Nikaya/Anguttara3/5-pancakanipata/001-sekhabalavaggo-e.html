</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>001.07. Bhikkhus, sentient beings dally much in sensuality. Bhikkhus, a clansman thoroughly burnt by sensuality turns away from home and becomes homeless. True to the words such a one has gone forth, through faith. What is the reason? When young, people gain sensual pleasures in one or another manner. There is sensual pleasure, which is low, middling and exalted. All this goes as sensuality. Just as a toddler owing to some negligence of the wet nurse would put a stick or a pebble in his mouth the wet nurse quickly thinking about it would take it out. If not possible to be taken out, the wet nurse would hold the toddler's head with the left hand and put a finger of the right hand into his mouth and would pull out the object together with blood. What is the reason? She knows its danger and does it out of compassion for the toddler. When he has grown up and also grown wise, he would suitably protect himself diligently, not needing a wet nurse any more.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner, so long as the bhikkhu does not engage in meritorious things based on faith, shame, remorse, effort and wisdom, he has to be protected by me. When the bhikkhu is engaged in meritorious things based on faith, shame, remorse, effort and wisdom, he does not need my protection any more. Thus he becomes a bhikkhu. It is not possible that the self protected bhikkhu should be negligent.</P>
