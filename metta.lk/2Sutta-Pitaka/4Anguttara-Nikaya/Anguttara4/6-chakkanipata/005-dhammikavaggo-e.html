</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>005.01. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. The Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered S&agrave;vatthi for the alms round. After the meal was over and returning from the alms round The Blessed One addressed venerable &acirc;nanda: &acirc;nanda, let us approach the Pubba monastery, the palace of Migara's mother&ntilde;o spend the day. Venerable &acirc;nanda agreed and The Blessed One approached the Pubba monastery with venerable &acirc;nanda. The Blessed One getting up from his evening seclusion addressed venerable &acirc;nanda: &acirc;nanda, let us go to the eastern pond to wash the body. The Blessed One approached the eastern pond with venerable &acirc;nanda. Having washed the body in the eastern pond, ascending from the pond stood in one robe to dry the body.</P>
<P>At that time king Pasenadi Kosala's great elephant named Seta with much musical sounds and dancing ascended from the eastern pond and the people there seeing it said: Friends, the king's elephant is beautiful! It is attractive! It is pleasing! It has a beautiful body! Indeed, the king's elephant is an elephant of elephants. Then venerable Udayi said to The Blessed One. Venerable sir, is it only for an elephant that is huge, well built and beautiful that people seeing it say: : It is an elephant of elephants? Udayi, they say. It is an elephant of elephants to an elphant, ... re ... to a horse, ... re ... to a bull, ... re ... to a snake, ... re ... to a tree and ... re ... even to a human. Udayi, seeing humans well built and attractive people say he is an elephant of elephants. Yet Udayi, I call him that does no evil in the world together with its gods, men, M&agrave;ra, Brahma, recluses and Brahmins by body, word or mind an elephant. These are excellent words of The Blessed One. I eulogize The Blessed One with these verses.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>A human, enlightened, tamed and concentrated, <BR>
Abides in the path of Brahma attached to appeasing the mind.<BR>
He has gone beyond all things, humans and gods worship that arahant <BR>
Destroying all bonds he has attained extinction<BR>
Not attached to sensuality, is released like a rock of gold <BR>
The elephant has climbed to the top of the Himalaya mountains<BR>
Of all names of the elephant incomparable is the best.<BR>
Elephant, I eulogize you. You do no evil. <BR>
Gentleness and not doing harm are your two feet<BR>
The other two are austerities and the holy life<BR>
Faith is the trunk, and equanimity the white tusks<BR>
Mindfulness is the neck and wisdom, investigation, <BR>
And righteous thinking are the top <BR>
The Teaching is the stomach and seclusion and dispelling is the tail<BR>
Concentrates attached to in breaths, goes, stands, lies and sits concentrated <BR>
The elephant is restrained in every way, these are his attainments<BR>
He does not partake food, with a fault, <BR>
Gaining food and clothes does not accumulate<BR>
Giving up bonds large and small, he goes without wishes<BR>
Like the scent of the lotus born in the water is not soiled by water <BR>
Likewise the well born Blessed One is not soiled in the world. <BR>
Like a great fire that extinguishes in want of fuel <BR>
When determinations are appeased, is extinguished <BR>
To explain this a comparison is said<BR>
A great man describes a Great Man <BR>
Free from greed, hate and delusion I dispel the body <BR>
And extinguish without desires.</P></DIR>

<P>Bhikkhus, the poor, incapable, miserable take a loan to pay the interest, and not paying the interest is pursued Is pursuit for the interest, unpleasant to worldlings enjoying sensual pleasures? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, the poor, incapable, miserable take a loan to pay the interest, and pursued for the interest evade. Is evasion from pursuit unpleasant to worldlings enjoying sensual pleasures? Yes, venerable sir. Bhikkhus, the poor, incapable, miserable take a loan to pay the interest, when evading to pay the interest, is caught. Is that round up, unpleasant to worldlings enjoying sensual pleasures? Yes, venerable sir. Thus bhikkhus, poverty is unpleasant to worldlings enjoying sensual pleasures ... re ... a debt, ... re ... paying an interest, ... re ... pursuit, ... re ... evasion, ... re ... and the round up is unpleasant to worldlings enjoying sensual pleassures.</P>
<P>In the same manner bhikkhus to whomever there is no faith in meritorious things, no shame in meritorious things, no remorse for meritorius things, no effort for meritorious things, no wisdom for meritorious things. Bhikkhus, this is poverty, incapacity misery in the dispensation of the noble ones.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the poor, incapable, miserable one, without faith in meritorious things, ... re ... shame ... re ... remorse, ... re ... effort and without wisdom in meritorious things misbehaves by body, words and mind I say, this is the loan that he takes. To conceal his bodily misbehaviour, he wishes evil, thinks may I be not known and makes effort with the body. I say, this is the interest he pays. Then well behaved co-associates tell him. Venerable one this is the right behaviour. I say, this is the pursuit. Then gone to the forest, the root of a tree or an empty house remorseful evil thoughts pursue him. I say, this is the evasion.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, that poor, incapable, miserable one, misbehaving by body, words and mind, after death is rounded up in hell or is bound in animal birth, I do not see any other bond so dangerous and evil as the bond of hell or the animal birth for the ending of unpleasantness.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Poverty and indebtedness are unpleasant, the poor eating on a loan worry.<BR>
They evade repaying and get rounded up. It is unpleasant for those seeking pleasure.<BR>
This same happens to those who have no faith in the noble one's dispensation.<BR>
The shameless ones, without remorse judged on their evil actions<BR>
Having done evil by body, words and mind, wish may I, be not known<BR>
Those thoughts develop activity by body, words and mind<BR>
Creeping low by body, words or mind they grow evil actions there and there<BR>
By his actions, the fool knows, I have done evil<BR>
It is like the poor taking a loan and worrying<BR>
Remorseful evil thoughts pursue him to village or forest<BR>
By his actions the fool knows, I have done evil.<BR>
He goes to some womb, or even to hell.<BR>
This bond is unpleasant, the wise are released from it.<BR>
They give out of their righteously earned wealth and are pleased<BR>
Both throws of those householders with faith are lucky.<BR>
Here and now and here after<BR>
The benevolence of those householders develop merit.<BR>
Likewise placing faith in the noble dispensation,<BR>
The shameful, remorseful, virtuous wise ones,<BR>
Live happily in the noble dispensation,<BR>
Gaining immaterial pleasantness get established in equanimity<BR>
Dispelling the five obstructions are constantly with aroused effort<BR>
Attaining to higher states of the mind, are clever and mindful<BR>
Knowing as it really is, has destroyed all bonds<BR>
Without holding to anything the mind is rightfully released<BR>
My release is unshakeable, the bond to be, is destroyed<BR>
This is the highest knowledge, the incomparable pleas&agrave;ntness<BR>
It is the non-grieving unstained appeasement the noble freedom from debts.</P></DIR>

<P>Good Gotama, it is wonderful and surprising. Good Gotama knows the intentions, discriminations, resolutions, inclinations and conclusions of the warriors, Brahmins, householders, women, robbers and recluses.</P>
<P>I understand good Gotama, I take refuge as a lay disciple of good Gotama, from today until life lasts.</P>

<P>Good Gotama, what is that one thing which developed and made much reaches up to both the good, here and now and here after?</P>
<P>Brahmin, diligence is the one thing, developed and made much reaches up to both the good, here and now and here after. Brahmin, just as all other foot prints of moving animals get included in the foot print of the elephant and of them&ntilde;he foot print of the elephant is the biggest, in the same manner diligence developed and made much reaches up to both the good, here and now and here after. Brahmin, just as of a peaked roof the beam supporting the framework of the roof is the most important. All other beams meet there and lie low in the same manner diligence developed and made much reaches up to both the good, here and now and here after. Brahmin, like a grass cutter would cut the grass and holding from the top would shake and throw away the others in the same manner diligence developed and made much reaches up to both the good, here and now and here after. Brahmin, like a bunch of mangoes stand together on account of the stem, in the same manner diligence developed and made much reaches up to both the good, here and now and here after.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>005.12. At one time The Blessed One lived among the Gijja peaks in Rajagaha. At that time venerable Dhammika lived in seven monasteries of his native land. At that time venerable Dhammika rebuked and scolded visiting bhikkhus, hurt them and aroused them. They too rebuked, scolded, hurt and aroused him and went away. It occured to the lay disciples of that village: We attend on the community of bhikkhus with robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Yet the visiting bhikkhus do not stay, they go away, they desert the monastery. What is the reason for these bhikkhus to go away? Then it occured to the lay disciples of the village: Venerable Dhammika rebukes and scolds visiting bhikkhus, hurts them and arouses them. They too rebuke, scold, hurt and arouse him and go away. What if we send away venerable Dhammika. They approached venerable Dhammika and said: Venerable one go away from this monastery, it is of no use your staying here.</P>
<P>Then venerable Dhammika went to another monastery of his native land. There too venerable Dhammika rebuked and scolded visiting bhikkhus, hurt them and aroused them. They too rebuked, scolded, hurt and aroused him and went away. It occured to the lay disciples of that village: We attend on the community of bhikkhus with robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Yet the visiting bhikkhus do not stay, they go away, they desert the monastery. What is the reason for these bhikkhus to go away?

<P>Then it occured to venerable Dhammika: I am dismissed from all seven monasteries of my native land, where shall I go now? Then it occured to venerable Dhammika. What if I go to The Blessed One: Then venerable Dhimmika taking his bowl and robes went to Rajagaha and gradually going to the Gijja peaks approached The Blessed One, worshipped sat on a side and said to The Blessed One: I am dismissed by the lay disciples from all seven monasteries of my native land.</P>
<P>Truly, Brahmin, what has happened to you? When you were dismissed from there and there, you came to my presence.</P>
<P>Dhammnika, in the past when traders were going in the sea, they took birds with them. When a beach is not visible they release a bird. The bird goes to the east, to the west, to the north and south, up and the inter directions. If it sees the coast some where it flies there, if it does not see the coast any where, it returns to the ship. Dhammika in the same manner, when you were dismissed from there and there, you came to my presence.</P>
<P>Brahmin Dhammika, in the past to king Koravya there was a banian tree named Suppatitthita it supported an area of about eighty four miles. It had roots running down to a depth of thrity five miles. Suppatitthita had fruits as large as huge vessels and fruits that are small, sweet and fresh. One of the shoots of Suppatitthita supported the king and the women in the palace. One shoot supported the forces. another shoot supported the people in the hamlets, villages and the state. Recluses and Brahmins partook from one branch and animals and birds ate from another shoot. They did not disturb each others fruits. A certain man ate fruits from Suppatitthatita as much as he liked, broke down the branches and went away. Then it occured to the goddess living in the banian tree, Suppatitthita: It is surprising this evil man eating as many fruits as he liked, has broken the branches and gone away. What if the banian tree Suppatitthita should not produce any more fruits in the future. Then Brahmin Dhammika, the banian tree, Suppatitthita did not bear fruit any more. Then Dhammika, king Koravya approached Sakka the king of gods. `Sir, know this, the banian tree Suppatitthita does not bear fruits any more. Then Sakka, the king of gods performed a supernormal fete, where a forceful great wind blew and the banian tree Suppatitthita fell on the ground, completely uprooted. Then the goddess living in the banian tree displeased, crying with tears in the eyes stood on a side. The king of gods approched the goddess living in the banian tree Suppatitthita and asked her `Goddess, why are you displeased crying with tears in the eyes and standing on a side? Sir, a forceful great wind blew and the banian tree Suppatitthita in which I live fell on the ground completely uprooted. Goddess, did a forceful great wind blow and fell the banian tree Suppatitthita, your dwelling when you were observing the rules of trees? Sir, what are the rules of trees to be observed? Here, goddess, those who need take away the roots of a tree, the bark of the tree, the leaves and flowers. On account of that the goddess should not be displeased or undesirable. Goddess, in this manner the tree observes the rules of trees. Sir, when I did not observe the rules of trees a forceful great wind blew and the banian tree Suppatitthita fell on the ground completely uprooted. Goddess, if you observe the rules of trees your dwelling will be as it was before. Sir, I observe the rules of trees and my dwelling should be as it was before. Then Sakka, the king of gods performed a supernormal fete, which caused a forceful great wind to blow and caused the banian tree Suppatitthita to be established again fixing the roots back, on to earth. In the same manner Brahmin Dhammika, were you observing the rules of recluses when the lay disciples of your native country dismissed you? Venerable sir, how does the recluse observe the rules of recluses? Here, Dhammika the recluse when scolded does not scold, when aroused does not arouse in return, when quarrelling does not quarrel Venerable sir, even if I had considered the rules of a recluse the lay disciples of my native land would dismiss me from all the seven monasteries.</P>
<P>Brahmin, Dhammika, in the past there was a Teacher a ford maker named Sunetta he was free of sensual greed. He had innumerable thousands of disciples. He taught his disciples to be born with Brahma. Dhammika, those who were not pleased with the Teaching of Sunetta, to be born in the Brahma world, after death went to loss, were born in hell. Those who were pleased with the Teaching of Sunetta, to be born in the Brahma world, after death went to gain, were born in heaven.</P>
<P>Brahmin, Dhammika, in the past there was a Teacher a ford maker named Mugapakkha ... re ... Aranemi, ... re ... Kuddalada, ... re ... Hatthipala ... re ... Jotipala he was free of sensual greed. He had innumerable thousands of disciples. He taught his disciples to be born with Brahma. Dhammika, those who were not pleased with the Teachings of Jotipala to be born in the Brahma world, after death went to loss, were born in hell. Those who were pleased with the Teachings of Jotipala to be born in the Brahma world, after death went to gain, were born in heaven.</P>
<P>Brahmin Dhammika, these six teachers, ford makers, free of sensual greed, who had an innumerable following, with a community of bhikkhus if someone with a defiled mind was to scold and abuse would he accure much demerit? Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Brahmin Dhammika, these six teachers, ford makers, free of sensual greed, had an innumerable following, with a community of bhikkhus if someone with a defiled mind was to scold and abuse them, they would accure much demerit. It would be worse if a single one who has attained right view is scolded and abused, he would accure much more demerit. What is the reason? I do not see this patience outside, other than among the co-associates in this holy life. Therefore Brahmin, you should train: </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>We will not defile our minds towards co-associates in the holy life.<BR>
The Brahmins Sunetta, Mugapakka, Aranemi, Kuddalaka, the teacher<BR>
Hatthipala the young man and Jotipala and Govinda the seventh advisor,<BR>
The famous non hurting six teachers in the past<BR>
Free of the smell of raw flesh, released in compassion.<BR>
Detached from sensual lust, are born in the world of Brahma<BR>
They had innumerable hundreds of disciples released in compassion<BR>
Detached from sensual lust, born in the world of Brahma<BR>
They are sages outside this dispensation, free of lust and concentrated<BR>
If someone with a defiled mind abuses them, he accures much demerit.<BR>
If a noble disciple of The Blessed One is abused with a defiled mind,<BR>
He accures much more demerit, so never hurt a respectable one,<BR>
Aspiring right view, he holds the seventh place in the Community of bhikkhus .<BR>
Free from sensual lust, but mental faculties are immature<BR>
Has faith, mindfulness, effort, is appeased and introspective<BR>
Having hurt such a bhikkhu you have hurt your self and now hurt others.<BR>
If someone protects himself, by that he protects others<BR>
Therefore the wise firmly say protect yourself.</P>
