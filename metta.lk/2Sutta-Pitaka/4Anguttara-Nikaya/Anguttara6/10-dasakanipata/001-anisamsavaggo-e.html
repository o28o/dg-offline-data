<P ALIGN="CENTER">1. Kimatthiyasutta&uuml; &Yacute; For what reason are merits</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>1. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. Venerable &acirc;nanda approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said: </P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits are clever virtues?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, clever virtues are for the reason and benefit of non-remorse.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is non-remorse?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, non-remorse is for the reason and benefit of delight.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is delight?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, delight is for the reason and benefit of joy"</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is joy?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, joy is for the reason and benefit of tranquility.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is tranquility?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, tranquility is for the reason and benefit of pleasantness.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is pleasantness?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, pleasantness is for the reason and benefit of concentration.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is concentration?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, concentration is for the reason and benefit of the vision of things as they really are"</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is the vision of things as they really are?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, the vision of things as they really are, is for the reason and benefit of turning away and disenchantment"</P>
<P>`&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is turning away and disenchantment?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, turning away and disenchantment is for the reason and benefit of the knowledge and vision of release"</P>
<P>Thus &acirc;nanda, clever virtues are for the reason and benefit of non-remorse. Non-remorse is for the reason and benefit of delight. Delight is for the reason and benefit of joy. Joy is for the reason and benefit of tranquility. Tranquility is for the reason and benefit of pleasantness. Pleasantness is for the reason and benefit of concentration. Concentration is for the reason and benefit of knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are. Knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are, is for the reason and benefit of turning away and disenchantment. Turning away and disenchantment is for knowledge and vision of release. Thus &acirc;nanda, clever virtues lead to the highest.</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+" SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">2. Cetan&agrave;karan&atilde;yasutta&uuml; &Yacute; Intending</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>2. &szlig;Bhikkhus, someone who has clever virtues, need not intend. `May non-remorse come to me.' It is the general rule for non-remorse to arise to a virtuous person. Someone who has no remorse, need not intend. `May delight come to me.' It is the general rule for delight to arise to one without remorse. Someone who is delighted need not intend. `May joy come to me.' It is the general rule for joy to arise to a delighted one. Someone who is joyful need not intend. `May my body be appeased' It is the general rule for the joyful to experience appeasement of the body. Someone with an appeased body need not intend. `May I feel pleasant.'It is the general rule for one with an appeased body to feel pleasant. A pleasant one, need not intend. `May my mind be concentrated.' It is the general rule for the pleasant one to be concentrated. Bhikkhus, someone with a concentrated mind need not intend. `May I know and see it, as it really is. It is the general rule for the concentrated to know and see as it really is. Bhikkhus, someone who knows and sees, as it really is, need not intend. `May I turn away and be disenchanted.' It is the general rule for one who knows and sees to turn away and be disenchanted. Bhikkhus, the one who has turned away and become disenchanted need not intend. `May I realize knowldge and vision of release' It is the general rule for one who turned away and is disenchanted to realize knowledge and vision of release.</P>
<P>Thus bhikkhus turning away and disenchantment is for knowledge and vision of release and its benefits. Knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are, is for turning away and disenchantment and its benefits. Concentration is for knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are, and their benefits. Pleasantness is for concentration and its benefits. Tranquility is for pleasantness and its benefits. Joy is for tranquility and its benefits. Delight is for joy and its benefits. Non-remorse is for delight and its benefits. Clever virtues are for non-remorse and its benefits. Thus bhikkhus, thoughts overflow from thoughts and get completed by thoughts, while they flow up and down.</P>
