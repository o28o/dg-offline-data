<p><img class="imad" alt="Monk's bowl, with mixed food (sweet and salt)" title="6th ascetic practice" src="../ph/sg03.jpg" /></p>
<h2 id="ch-----1">The origin</h2>
<p class="let">Long before Buddha appeared into this world, there did exist ascetic practices designed for oppressing the body in as variegated as numerous ways. Those who adopted them believed that they would enable them to get liberated from the sorrow any living being. On the other hand, others were convinced that the ultimate goal of existence lied in knowing how to enjoy it to the full and focused all their efforts on best enjoying sensuous pleasures.</p>
<p>From his very first teaching, Buddha categorically rejected these two paths that he qualified of « extreme paths ». In this teaching, he explains us that only the moderate path, the « middle path », can lead us to the development of wisdom and right knowledge of reality. The two extreme paths develop, on their behalf, attachments and false views, contrary to the moderate path, which enables the lessening of attachments and the development of right view.</p>
<p>The conduct laid down by the Blessed one for monks and nuns (the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pātimokkha</span>), for novices (the 10 precepts) and for the laity (the 5 or 8 precepts) is sufficient guidance to anyone who conveniently trains into <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">satipaṭṭhāna</span>. To those who wish to much more rapidly or easily reach <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nibbāna</span>, he also taught a set of ascetic practices which are non-compulsory (the 13 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> that are not included into the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span>), which enables to reduce one's needs to the least, thus sparing, the one who adopts these practices, from pride, greed, and aversion, which constitute the main poisons on the path to liberation (only by practising certain <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> in daily life can we really understand this fact; results are impressing).</p>
<p><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> are not designed for superior beings, neither for inferior beings. They are beneficial for all those who are able to put them into practice. A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> is not an extreme practice; it is a mere practice that enables the mind to be rapidly and easily purified, absolute prerequisite to the development of attention and concentration. It reduces useless impediments, such as excessive food, numerous clothes to look after, the agitation of inhabited areas, very various attachments. Provided it is conveniently adopted, no <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> does cause to arise any kind of tiredness or oppression of the body or the mind. If a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> involves a great difficulty or a difficult effort to an individual, he shouldn't practice it, as it would become a practice extreme for himself.</p>
<p>Everyone is free, according to his capacities and wishes, to adopt one or several <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>, which each comprises three levels of restriction. The aim of these practices lies in providing an environment as auspicious as possible for renunciation.</p>
<p>Thus, the 13 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>, which mean " renunciation " [to abandon (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhuta</span>); state of mind (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">aṅga</span>)], are a set of practices designed for considerably reducing our attachments, in order to reach <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nibbāna</span> at the soonest, like a bird that crosses the cloudless sky on a straight line.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----3">The five kinds of motivations</h2>
<p class="let">For the practice of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>, there do exist several kinds of motivations. A few can adopt one of them out of a bad purpose, in the aim of stirring up admiration around themselves, whereas others adopt one of these practices out of a genuine purpose, in order to cure themselves from <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kilesās</span>, with the same state of mind into which one takes a medicine. Here are the five kinds of motivation that we can distinguish among those who adopt one or more <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>:</p>
<p>1) Out of complete ignorance, without even knowing their advantages: after having merely heard the practitioners of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> are of good renown, for being able to say " me, I practice the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>", etc.</p>
<p>2) For benefitting with the advantages feeding up greed, such as: for receiving a lot of gifts, for being well considered by others, for causing a great veneration to arise from others, for attracting disciples to oneself, etc.</p>
<p>3) Out of madness, out of complete ignorance, without being in quest for anything whatsoever.</p>
<p>4) Because Buddha and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">ariyās</span> praise such practices.</p>
<p>5) For benefitting with healthy advantages, such as: the capacity to be contented with very little, weakness inherent to greed, easiness to obtain what is needed, tranquillity, detachment, etc.</p>
<p>Buddha disapproved the first three motivations, he only approved the last two. An individual may then adopt one or several <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> only if he is motivated according to the fourth or fifth among these five kinds of motivations. However, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> is of much higher benefit if it is adopted according to the fifth motivation instead of the fourth.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----4">The five factors that ought to be developed by a practitioner of the dhutaṅgas</h2>
<p class="let">A practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> who is in the position of doing such practices (he undergoes a good state of health, etc.), who is honest and who has <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nibbāna</span> as goal, is worthy to be worshipped by the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">brahmās</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">devas</span> and humans.</p>
<p>Here are the five factors which each practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> should develop:</p>
<ol>
<li>To be without greed.</li>
<li>To know how to be contented with very little.</li>
<li>To really want to get rid of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kilesās</span>.</li>
<li>To remain on a calm spot.</li>
<li>To no longer wish any extra existence in whatsoever world and conditions (in other parlance, wishing <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parinibbāna</span>).</li>
</ol>
<p>The first factors are against greed. They contribute in eliminating sensory desires. The might whose the last of these factors is object can be cultivated by means of wisdom.</p>
<p>Through <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">alobha</span> we eliminate pratices that are meant for developing sensory desires (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kāmasukhallikā nuyoga</span>), and through <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">amoha</span>, we eradicate all practices that oppress the body (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">attakilamathā nuyoga</span>).</p>
<p>Buddha congratulates those who adopt the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> by fully developing the above mentioned five factors.</p>
<p>According to another commentary, the factors needed to the practice of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> are:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saddhā</span>, faith, confidence.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">hirimā</span>, the fact to be afraid or ashamed of evil deeds.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhitimā</span>, the fact to be calm, self-possessed and concentrated on one's deeds.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">akuha</span>, the indifference towards notoriety, renown, consideration on others' behalf.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">atthavasī</span>, the fact to have the realisation of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> as unique aim.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">alobha</span>, straightforwardness.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sikkhākāma</span>, the fact to be naturally and constantly virtuous.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">aḷhasamādāna</span>, the fact to prevent oneself from breaking one of these practices.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">anujjhānabahula</span>, the fact not to criticize others, even if they are at fault.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mettāvihārī</span>, the fact to constantly remain filled with benevolence.</li>
</ol>
<p>A serious practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> has to be conveniently rooted into one of these ten factors. The one who knows how to stick to it is in the position to reach <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nibbāna</span>.</p>
<p>The elements that ought to be avoide:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pāpiccha</span>, to want unhealthy things.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">icchāpakata</span>, to oppress one's mind through desires.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kuhaka</span>, to try to draw consideration from others.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">luddha</span>, covetousness, cupidity.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">odarika</span>, to be abusively preoccupied by one's food.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">lābhakāma</span>, to want to get involved into numerous matters.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">yasakāma</span>, to want to have many disciples, to want to be worshipped by many people.</li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kittikāma</span>, to want notoriety, a great renown.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> practises the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> according to one or several of these eight points, he will certainly be subject to criticism and contempt on others' behalf. He even risks to experience some disabilities during his next existence, such as ugliness, malformation, a severed limb, if it is not the realm of hells. That's why one should strive for developing the needed factors, and to avoid those who are detrimental.</p>

<p class="let">In order to adopt the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> that one wishes to practice, the ideal prospect lies in doing it before Buddha's presence.</p>
<p>If Buddha is far away or no more, it is beneficial to adopt the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> before the presence of an <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">aggasāvaka</span> (appellation given to Buddha's two most nobles disciples).</p>
<p>If the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">aggasāvakas</span> are far away or no more, we can do it before the presence of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mahāsāvaka</span> (appellation given to the 80 greatest disciples of a Buddha).</p>
<p>If the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mahāsāvakas</span> are far away or no more, we can do it before the presence of an r<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">arahanta</span>.</p>
<p>If we can't seize the opportunity doing it before the presence of an <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">arahanta</span>, we can do it before the presence of an <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">anāgāmi</span>.</p>
<p>If we can't seize the opportunity doing it before the presence of an <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">anāgāmi</span>, we can do it before the presence of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sakadāgāmi</span>.</p>
<p>If we can't seize the opportunity doing it before the presence of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sakadāgāmi</span>, we can do it before the presence of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sotāpana</span>.</p>
<p>If we can't seize the opportunity doing it before the presence of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sotāpana</span>, we can do it before the presence of someone who perfectly knows the three parts of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tipiṭaka</span>.</p>
<p>If we can't seize the opportunity doing it before the presence of someone who perfectly knows the three parts of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tipiṭaka</span>, we can it before the presence of someone who perfectly knows two of the three parts of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tipiṭaka</span>.</p>
<p>If we can't seize the opportunity doing it before the presence of someone who perfectly knows two of the three parts of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tipiṭaka</span>, we can it before the presence of someone who perfectly knows one of the three parts of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tipiṭaka</span>.</p>
<p>If we can't seize the opportunity doing it before the presence of someone who perfectly knows one of the three parts of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tipiṭaka</span>, we can it before the presence of someone who perfectly knows one of the chapters of one of the three parts of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tipiṭaka</span>.</p>
<p>If we can't seize the opportunity doing it before the presence of someone who perfectly knows one of the chapters of one of the three parts of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tipiṭaka</span>, we can it before the presence of someone who is well versed into the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">aṭṭhakathās</span> (commentaries).</p>
<p>If we can't seize the opportunity doing it before the presence of someone is well versed into the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">aṭṭhakathās</span> (commentaries), we can do it before the presence of someone who practises the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>.</p>
<p>If no one be present, we can do it before a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">cetiya</span>.</p>
<p>It is better to adopt one or several <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> before the presence of a being endowed with a pure <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīla</span>. This incites us to better take care of our practice of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> and to avoid breaking them. However, should one wish to adopt a few <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> beyond anybody's acknowledgement, it is possible to do it all alone. A few monks besides take determination not to let anyone know about their practice, thus solidly establishing within himself the certainty not to practice them owing to an unhealthy motivation.</p>
<p>In olden days, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> practised the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> that consists in eating only once a day (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">ekāsanika</span>) since forty years, with no one ever coming to know about it. One day, someone saw him finishing up his meal, standing up and proceeding to instal himself at another spot. At this specific moment, he proposed him a piece of cake. As the Venerable politely refused it, the donor guessed for which reason, telling loudly: " You practise the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga ekāsanika</span>! " In order not to tell lies and not to disclose his practice, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> preferred not to break it by accepting and by eating this piece of cake. As soon as he had ingested the cake, he again adopted this <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span>.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----6">The dhutaṅgas to be practised according to the status</h2>
<p class="let">Alone, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> can practise the 13 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>. <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span> can only practise 8 of them, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇeras</span> can only practise 12, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇerīs</span> can only practise 7 and the laity can only practise 2, even 9, as their status or discipline doesn't enable them to adopt the others.</p>
<h3>bhikkhus</h3>
<p>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> can adopt any of the 13 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>. If he wishes so, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> can practise the whole 13 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> at once. To that sake, the best would be to exclusively dwell by a charnel that possesses at the same time the characteristics of a forest spot &ndash; remote from inhabited areas &ndash; and from those of a spot devoid of shelter and vegetation. However, he can also dwell in a forest during the first third of the night, on a spot devoid of shelter and vegetation during the second third of the night, and in a charnel devoid of the characteristics specific to the forest spots and devoid of shelter during the last third of the night.</p>
<p>We may wonder how to practise at the same time the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> that consists in dwelling beneath a tree (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">rukkhamūla</span>) and the one that consists in dwelling on a spot devoid of shelter and vegetation (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">abbhokāsika</span>). Even though being the translation of the term " dwellling beneath a tree ", the main idea of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">rukkhamūla dhutaṅga</span> is not that much to adopt a tree, but to renounce to material comfort instead &ndash; likely to cause laziness to arise &ndash; and to all maintenance duties involved by residing in a building compound. Thus, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">abbhokāsika dhutaṅga</span> includes the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">rukkhamūla dhutaṅga</span>. In the same day, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> that consists in renouncing to the residence in a building compound (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">rukkhamūla</span>) and the one that consists in renouncing to spots provided with vegetation and shelter (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">abbhokāsika</span>) do no prevent one from practising the one lying in dwelling " in a forest " (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">āraññika</span>), as this later consists in not adopting a monastery situated into the deep forest. His only idea lies indeed in living remote from inhabited aeras, the residence on a recluse, isolated spot. On the contrary, it is possible to practise the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">abbhokāsika dhutaṅga</span> or the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">rukkhamūla dhutaṅga</span> without practising the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">āraññika dhutaṅga</span>, for example, by dwelling beneath a tree situated in inhabited areas.</p>
<h3>Bhikkhunīs</h3>
<p>The 8&nbsp;<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span> are able to practice are: <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">paṃsukūla, tecīvarika, piṇḍapāta, sapadānacāri, ekāsanika, pattapiṇḍika, yathāsantatika</span> and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nesajjika</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">khalupacchābhattika dhutaṅga</span> is obsolete to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span>, as their <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> forbids them to refuse food that is being served to them, even after having started to eat (according to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pavārito</span>, see the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pācittiya</span>&nbsp;35). They cannot practise the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">āraññika dhutaṅga</span> as their <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> forbids them to dwell in an isolated spot, without a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> monastery located close by (according to the ohīyana rule). Regarding the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">rukkhamūla</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">abbhokāsika</span> and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">susānika dhutaṅga</span>, Buddha does not authorize them to adopt them, as being women, these practices are too difficult and too dangerous. Moreover, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span> cannot proceed alone outside of the monastic complex. Supposing that it would be permitted to a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span> to dwell on a spot remote from <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> monasteries, accompanied with another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span>, she would have it difficult finding another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span> who agrees to practise the same <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> along with her, without referring to the fact that the main interest of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> lies to practise them alone.</p>
<h3>Sāmaṇeras</h3>
<p><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇeras</span> are able to practise the 12 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>; all to the exclusion of the practice that lies in confining oneself to three robes (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tecīvarika</span>), as, on the contrary of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span>, they have no double robe at disposal. Admittedly, nothing does prevent <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇeras</span> from training into utilising a very limited number of robes, shawls or blankets. However, this will not be the object of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tecīvarika dhutaṅga</span>.</p>
<h3>Sikkhamānas and Sāmaṇerīs</h3>
<p>The 7 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> that <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sikkhamānas</span> and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇerīs</span> are able to practise are: <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">paṃsukūla, piṇḍapāta, sapadānacāri, ekāsanika, pattapiṇḍika, yathāsantatika</span> and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nesajjika</span>.</p>
<p>They cannot practise the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">khalupacchābhattika</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">āraññika</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">rukkhamūla</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">abbhokāsika</span>, and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">susānika dhutaṅga</span>, and for the same reasons as <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span> can't and, regarding the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">tecīvarika dhutaṅga</span>, for the same reasons as <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇeras</span> can't.</p>
<h3>The laities</h3>
<p>The 2 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> that the laity &ndash; nuns included &ndash; are able to practise are: <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">ekāsanika</span> (a single meal per day) and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pattapiṇḍika</span> (taking one's meal by means of a single recipient). However, a laity strongly enclined to the practice of renunciation, purity of the mind, and to a great confidence into the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, can, following the example of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>, adopt two above mentioned extra <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">khalupacchābhattika</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">āraññika</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">rukkhamūla</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">abbhokāsika</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">susānika</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">yathāsantatika</span> and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nesajjika dhutaṅga</span>, which raise the total number of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> to 9.</p>
<p>However, the laity cannot practise the first four <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>, as they do not wear any monastic robe and do not obtain their food by means of a bowl.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----7">ariyās and the dhutaṅgas</h2>
<p class="let"><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">ariyās</span> are beings who have inevitably practised the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> in this life or in a former rebirth. To have one's <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pāramīs</span> sufficiently matured for the realisation of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, the practise of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> is therefore inevitable. For this reason, we can say that " the practice of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> is the path of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">ariyās</span> ". The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> even constitute a training particularly auspicious to the realisation of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nibbāna</span>, given the fact that they offer the best conditions for the training into the 8 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">maggaṅgas</span> &ndash; the basis of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">satipaṭṭhāna</span> (the path that leads to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nibbāna</span>) &ndash; on one hand, and for the detachment from all obstacles to this training on the other.</p>
<p>There do exist numerous <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> who are renown for their practice of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>. Among others, in Buddha's time, regarding the practice of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">āraññika</span> and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">paṃsukūla dhutaṅgas</span>, Venerable Mahā Kassapa was particularly renown (besided recognised by Buddha as being the best practitioner of the 13 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> of his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāsana</span>); then were particularly renown for the observance of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">āraññika dhutaṅga</span>: Venerable Revata (in the forest of Khariravaniya), Venerable Tissa and Venerable Nāgita; was particularly renown for the observance of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> linked with the obtention and consumption of food: Venerable Mitta; were particularly renown for the observance of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nesajjika dhutaṅga</span>: Venerable Sāriputtarā, Venerable Mahā Moggalāna, Venerable Cakkhupāla, etc.</p>
<p>These <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">arahantas</span> &ndash; such as all <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">arahantas</span> who practise the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> &ndash; haven't gone through the difficulties of these practices for their own benefit, as they no longer have anything to obtain for themselves (an <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">arahanta</span> has, by definition, no more ambition, neither motivation). They have practised the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> with the only aim of favorably making an example, inciting to the observance of this noble practice other <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> who see them or would come to hear about them.</p>
<p>All Buddhas have also practised the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> in a remarkable manner, at one or several moments of their last existence. Thus, wise people, imitating Bouddha, put into practice one or several of these <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>.</p>
