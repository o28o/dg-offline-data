The only way of retaking the robe &ndash; of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> &ndash; is to wait for a future existence.Whoever commits such an offence must disrobe immediately.

<h2 id="ch-----2">Regarding the saṃghādisesas</h2>
<h3>The expiation of a saṃghādisesa</h3>
<p class="let">When a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> has been committed, it is possible to expiate it, but this is rather complicated and requires close surveillance of the offending <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> by the other members of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> throughout the entire duration of the procedure.</p>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who commits a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> must inform another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> of what he has done as soon as possible. If he does not report his offence, a day is counted as one day of concealment of the offence from the passage of the following dawn. The number of days, months or years during which the transgression is concealed will be the same as the time required to submit to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> (the period of expiation of the fault).</p>
<p>When a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> has been committed, there are three exceptional cases in which the number of days without confessing the fault is not taken into account: The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> does not know that he has committed a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span>; there are no other <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> in the area; there is a danger along the route leading to the nearby <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>.</p>
<h3>The application of the parivāsa</h3>
<p>For a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> to put the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> in practice, he must first receive a reading of the fourth <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">ñatti kammavācā</span> in the presence of at least four <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> within the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīmā</span>.</p>
<p>Next, the offending <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must confess all the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> that he has committed as well as the number of days during which this (these) fault (s) has been concealed, so that the ensuing <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> can be established. If the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is unable to remember precisely what <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> he has committed or the number of days he has kept the faults hidden, he must say: "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sabbahulā nānāvatthukā āpattiyo</span>." In English: "All the faults of all kinds."</p>
<h4>suddhantaparivāsa</h4>
<p>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who commits a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> through negligence could easily forget the date. If he is unable to say how long he has concealed the offence, he must give an estimate of the number of days, months or years during which he thinks he has concealed the transgression. Next, the duration of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> is established, making sure that it is at least of the same length as the concealment time. If he is unable to estimate the duration, he is asked how many <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassas</span> he is certain to have remained pure &ndash; of that <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> &ndash;, and what is his total number of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassas</span>. The difference between the two is then used to establish the duration of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>.</p>
<p>The establishment of the length of expiation for a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> through an estimate is called <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">suddhanta parivāsa</span>.</p>
<h4>samodhānaparivāsa</h4>
<p>If the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> has committed several <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> with different times of concealment, the length of expiation is calculated by taking into account the longest duration of concealment among all the transgressions of all kinds. This case is called "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">samodhānaparivāsa</span>" and three kinds are distinguished (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">odhānasamodhānaparivāsa</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">aggha samodhānahmā</span> and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">missaka samodhāna</span>).</p>
<h5>odhānasamodhānaparivāsa</h5>
<p>When a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> commits a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> during an expiation period, the latter loses its validity and must be started again from the beginning, with the addition of the number of days during which the new offence was concealed.</p>
<h5>agghasamodhānahmā</h5>
<p>When several <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> have been committed, the greater duration of concealment is taken into account to establish the length of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>.</p>
<h5>missakasamodhāna</h5>
<p>If a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> commits different kinds of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span>, these are all grouped into one in order to establish the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>.</p>
<h4>Recommencing the expiation after the beginning (mūlāyapaṭikassana)</h4>
<p>If a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> commits a new <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> during his expiation period, he must immediately declare it in the presence of another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>. The offence committed during this time is called "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">antarāpatti</span>". If this transgression is concealed at least overnight, the past expiation period is invalidated and must be re-started from the beginning, with the addition of the number of days of concealment of the new transgression. In Pali this is called "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mūlāyapaṭikassana</span>".</p>
<h3>The thirteen penances of the saṃghādisesa</h3>
<p>Having committed a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span>, those <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> doing <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> are subject to a series of penances aimed at purifying the transgression (or transgressions). These penances must be applied following very precise rules.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance <strong>must not sleep either under the same roof or between the same walls as a</strong> <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pakatatta bhikkhu</span> (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> pure of any fault). Neither can he sleep under the same roof or between the same walls as <strong>another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span></strong> undergoing penance. If he sleeps under the same roof or between the same walls as a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pakatatta bhikkhu</span> or another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance, he commits a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dukkaṭa</span> and the number of nights thus spent increases the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> by as many days.</li>
<li>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must <strong>reside within the confines of a monastery where there is at least one <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pakatatta bhikkhu</span></strong>. If he leaves these confines, he must <strong>not distance himself more than</strong> twelve cubits &ndash; around <strong>six metres &ndash; from a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pakatatta bhikkhu</span></strong>. If he spends a night in a place without a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pakatatta bhikkhu</span>, this increases the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> by a day.</li>
<li><strong>Every time a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> arrives to the monastery</strong>, when he is informed, sees or hears of this, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must notify the arriving <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> that he is in a period of <strong><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span></strong> following a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span>. If he does not notify this, his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> is lengthened by a day. However, if the arrival is a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> to whom he had already reported his transgression, he only commits a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dukkaṭa</span>.</li>
<li>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must <strong>not accept prostrations</strong>, homage, invitations to sit in a privileged place <strong>or any other expression of respect</strong> from <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pakatatta bhikkhu</span> (even those with less <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassas</span> than him). However, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> undergoing penance can accept signs of respect from each other.</li>
<li>During <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">uposatha</span> and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pavāraṇā</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must <strong>take his place among those of least seniority</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>During rice collection</strong>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must not place himself in the same line as the other <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>. He must <strong>place himself behind</strong> this line <strong>by at least</strong> twelve cubits and one span (around <strong>120 centimetres</strong>) <strong>and</strong> must <strong>extend his arms to accept the food</strong>.</li>
<li>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance <strong>must neither act as preceptor or instructor, nor can he give the reading of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kammavācā</span></strong>.</li>
<li>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must <strong>not receive services from the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇeras</span></strong>. To this effect, he must forbid them to do so. However, if the <strong><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇera</span></strong> continue to render him services despite having been told not to, he does not commit an offence.</li>
<li>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must <strong>not boast of his seniority</strong> to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> who have less <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassas</span> than him when addressing them.</li>
<li>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must <strong>not reside alone in a forest <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vihāra</span></strong>.</li>
<li>When a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance sees that a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pakatatta bhikkhu</span> less senior than himself approaches, he must get up to give him his place as if it was a more senior <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>.</li>
<li>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must <strong>not sit on the same bed with a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pakatatta bhikkhu</span></strong> that has the same number of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassas</span> than him.</li>
<li>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance <strong>cannot be part of those who integrate a new <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> or perform tasks</strong> concerning the running of <strong>the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span></strong> other than the specific tasks provisionally assigned to him.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notification of the parivāsa</h3>
<p>Of the whole <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> procedure, the most difficult aspect is the notification of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>. After having formally confessed his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīmā</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must notify that he is performing <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> because of such fault to all the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> that he meets, as soon as he sees or hears them. If he hears a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> recite a text or beating a drum in the area, he must go to him straight away to notify his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>. When on the road, if the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance notices a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> inside a vehicle, he is obliged to stop this vehicle to notify his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>. If he fails in this duty, he commits a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dukkaṭa</span> and his expiation period is extended by one day (in Pali, the failure to comply with an obligation [penance] due in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> is vattabheda). If a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance does not succeed in reaching a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> travelling inside a vehicle to report his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>, he does not commit a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dukkaṭa</span>, but his expiation period is increased by one day.</p>
<p>The obligations imposed by the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> are relatively overpowering. Thus, it is recommended to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> undergoing penance to reside in an isolated (little frequented) monastery during their expiation period.</p>
<h3>Rescinding the parivāsa</h3>
<p>The obligations imposed by the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> are difficult. However, it is possible to rescind it, thus reducing the risk of failing to fulfill those obligations.</p>
<p>To rescind the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance must first of all, enter the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīmā</span> to request the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>, the delivery of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>, the application of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> and finally the notification of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>. Thanks to rescinding the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> undergoing penance is exempted from notifying to all the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> passing by the monastery soon as he sees or hears them. During the cancellation of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>, he can be considered as a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pakatatta bhikkhu</span>. The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who commits a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> during his expiation period can include it in his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> by grouping it with the preceding one.</p>
<p>When the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> has been rescinded, it is restored automatically at dawn. To maintain it rescinded, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must then say a formula in Pali to another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> just before dawn, and to another just after dawn. The first rescindement of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> must be done in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīmā</span> in the presence of at least four <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>. For the following ones, it is acceptable if there are only two <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>.</p>
<p>However, it is more appropriate to go and dwell in a secluded monastery and pursue the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> there (without rescinding it).</p>
<h3 id="manatta">The practice of mānatta</h3>
<p>In order to regain the esteem and respect of the other <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> and for his practice of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīla</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> in the expiation period must apply the practice of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span>.</p>
<p>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who on the same day reveals a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> he has committed, has no need to undergo <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>. He is, however, obliged to undergo <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span>. Counting the number of days is not necessary; six days are assigned. To put <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> in practice, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who has committed the transgression must proceed to request <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> within the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīmā</span> in the presence of at least four <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>.. The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> transmits the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> through a reading of the fourth <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">ñatti kammavācā</span>. Next, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> is put into practice, and, by reason of this, the notification of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span>. As with the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> must also be notified to all the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> seen or heard arriving at the monastery, and can be rescinded. To rescind the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> in the period of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> must first of all go outside the enclosures of the monastery before dawn, together with at least four <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> (if there is no wall or enclosure, they must go to a minimum distance of two stone throws from the corner of the furthest building of the monastery). There, at the side of the road, behind a bush (or anything else permitting to be out of view), he will put the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> in practice, and performs the notification of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span>. Once dawn has passed, he can rescind the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span>.</p>
<p>Although the practice of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> is similar to that of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> lasts a time equal to the time the offence has been concealed, whereas <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> has a fixed duration of six days. Rescinding the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> requires four <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> only the first time, whereas the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> requires this for each of the six days</p>
<h3>Leaving the saṃgha during the period of parivāsa or of mānatta</h3>
<p>When a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> disrobes during his period of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> or of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> to return to lay life, or to the life of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇera</span>, this <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> or <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> is automatically interrupted. However, if he retakes the robes of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>, he must continue the period of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> or <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> in order to complete the remaining number of days, without having to restart the period. However, if he has proceeded to rescind the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> or the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span>, he must retake the procedure from the beginning.</p>
<p>When re-entering the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who has disrobed having committed one or more <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> without confessing them, recovers them automatically and is obliged to reveal them and follow the proper procedure (without counting the time spent outside the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>).</p>
<h3>The reintegration (abbhāna)</h3>
<p>When the period of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> or of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span> is fulfilled, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">abbhāna</span> takes place among the other members of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>. Thus, everybody can take note that the offence has been completely purified. The abbhāna designs the reconsideration, reacceptance and reintegration within the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">abbhāna</span> must take place during a meeting of at least twenty <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>. So that these pure <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> can perform the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">abbhāna</span> by reading the fourth <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi"><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">ñatti kammavācā</span></span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> about to purify his fault must formulate his request to them. For the offence to be purified, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must reject his point of view. If he has not done this at the end of three consecutive readings of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">ñatti kammavācā</span>, he continues to be in <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span>. Concerning the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> 10, 11, 12 and 13, as long as the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> has not rejected his point of view, he cannot initiate the expiation period (practice of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parivāsa</span> or of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mānatta</span>). Once the whole procedure has been fulfilled, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who has committed the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span> can again be considered a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pakatatta bhikkhu</span>.</p>

If this is an object that the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is allowed to keep, he only relinquishes it momentarily to another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>, who next returns it. The procedure of purification of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nissaggiya</span> is carried out in two phases: in the first, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must give up the object that he has obtained or caused to be offered in an incorrect manner; next, he must purify his fault by means of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">desanā</span>.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----6">The desanā</h2>
<p class="let">Performing <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">desanā</span> is a means to purify the offences (excluding the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pārājika</span> and the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃghādisesa</span>) that <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> commit. This is done regularly or whenever becoming aware of having committed an offence. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> to perform this daily in order to purify the multitude of minor transgressions that most of them commit without noticing. Thus one abides always at ease with onself. It is imperative to do <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">desanā</span> just before the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pātimokkha</span> recitation (on every full moon and every new moon) so that, through this, all the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> have pure <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīla</span> at that time.</p>
<p>To do this, with the robe arranged around the left arm (traditional although not obligatory), the more senior kneels, with bare feet, and the most junior <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> does the same placing himself in front or to the side. <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">desanā</span> can be done in twos or threes. In the case of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">desanā</span> in threes, the two more junior place themselves facing or to the side of the most senior and confess their faults together. At that moment, the most junior <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> addresses the more senior to purify his faults. Next, the senior <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> addresses the more junior by reciting, in the same way, a second verse. As a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> can only be "purified" by a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who is already pure, the most junior pronounces again a third verse. For this reason, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who wishes to purify his faults with a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who has just done <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">desanā</span>, only needs to use the first verse. Below, la formula of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">desanā</span> that must be recited in Pali:</p>
<p>(The text that must be recited by the more senior is in <em>italic</em>).</p>
