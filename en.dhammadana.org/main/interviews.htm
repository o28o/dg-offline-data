<h4>Interview with Monk Sīla Vanta</h4>
<p><img class="imad" alt="The future monk and his luggage" title="Arrival in the Mahāsī meditation centre, with suitcases full of offerings for the samgha." src="../ph/em1.jpg" /><span class="rem">DhammaDāna.org:</span> <strong>Why did you take the robe?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">Monk Sīla Vanta:</span> The decision doesn't lie in taking the robe. Let us simply say that it allows me to experience the life style that I find the most convenient for me. The life of the laity is very complicated. There is so much suffering from birth to death, we ceaselessly endure pains, sicknesses, old age, etc. There are so many things to tell on the subject, but mainly, being a monk enables me to set my mind free from all these things and also to perform numerous merits.</p>
<p>By remaining a lay person, we have so many preoccupations, we have no time to fully commit ourselves to the practice of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>. If moreover, we have a family, we must unceasingly look after everybody.</p>
<p>The life of the laity is too complicated. We remain in it as if locked in a jail. Buddha has found the means to get out of it; so why not trying it?</p>
<p>After mature reflections, I have ascertained that in life, there are two possible paths: the path of money and the path of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>. I have chosen the path of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>.</p>
<p><img class="imag" alt="The future monk, wiht a white tee-shirt and his black hairs" title="The future monk is ready to get totally immersed into a vipassanā retreat, with or without robe." src="../ph/em2.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Why did you come to Myanmar whereas we find Christian monasteries in France inside of which you can also devote yourself to meditation?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> The reflections I have had all along my life have always been in harmony with that which is found in Buddha's teaching. I have chosen Myanmar because I think that it is the only country where it is still possible to find auspicious conditions to a serious practice of <span class="pit" title="direct vision in the reality" xml:lang="pi">vipassanā</span>.</p>
<p>Contrarily to other teachings, Buddha's one always seemed to me to be something true, which we can verify by ourselves.</p>
<p><img class="imad" alt="Close-up on the blade shaving his skull" title="Hair are no longer needed, as their maintenance is a source of useless task." src="../ph/em3.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>What does differentiate the most your monastic life from your lay life?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> The life of a monk is much simpler, there are many less worries. Whereas the life of the laity continuously bring about money, work, family problems, etc. Whereas the life of a monk is very simple, we practise the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>. We do not ask for anything, we are merely self-contented with the offerings that the people want to make us, that's all.</p>
<p><img class="imag" alt="The future monk is smiling, his skull is smooth" title="Now the skull has got rid of its hair, the only thing that ought to get done is getting the mind rid of its impurities." src="../ph/em4.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Is it not too difficult, from one day to the next, to do away with the comfort of a lay life?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> Oh no! I have always dreamt to be a monk! I do not think that I will step backward. I feel very well here. I think treading the right path and I am resolved to remain on it.</p>
<p>Truthfully speaking, I had no problem in severing myself from lay life, as despite all the comfort I enjoyed, I wasn't happy within myself. Whether being a lay man or even a monk, I feel quite indifferent to comfort. I am only after <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vipassanā</span> and wisdom.</p>
<p><img class="imad" alt="Le futur monk is respectfully sitting front of the instructor" title="Robes in hands, asking from the preceptor to receive the 10 precepts of samanera." src="../ph/em5.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Don't you miss your family and friends?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> Absolutely not. I don't miss my family at all. I however do not forget them, but now I must set everything aside, as I must commit myself to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vipassanā</span>. I therefore cannot allow myself to think of anybody whosoever, nor even of anything whatsoever. In this moment, I try to get out of all this (to liberate myself) . Then, when I will have the opportunity, I will help others to the best of my capabilities.</p>
<p>Regarding friends, I don't have any and have never had any. I am therefore secure on this issue.</p>
<p><img class="imag" alt="Helping the future monk to wear his robe" title="Time has come to wear the cloth that is the poorest and the noblest thing at the same time." src="../ph/em6.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>As a monk, do you believe to be useful to others?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> I believe to be so provided the ones listening to me trust me. That which Buddha gave to us is so precious, I would like to be able to make as many people as possible benefit from it. I will try my best to teach <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>. I will explain others what <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vipassanā</span> really is, and how we should do to liberate ourselves and to indulge in some vain recitations and beliefs. I will try to explain them in a limpid way so that they can understand. Those who do not understand, I wish that they will be able to understand one day.</p>

<p><img class="imad" alt="Wearing the monastic robe, the future monk join respectfully the hands" title="Taking of the 10 precepts of samanera, compulsory step before integrating the monastic community." src="../ph/em7.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>What does please or displease in the fact to be a monk?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> There is nothing that displeases me, but nothing pleases me either. It is the middle path.</p>
<p><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Which are, according to you, the advantages of such a life style?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> We enjoy more time to devote ourselves to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vipassanā</span>, and to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>. Whereas in lay life, the opposite thing occurs: we never have time for it. As monks, we are more likely to teach <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>.</p>
<p><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>For how long do you intend experiencing a monastic life?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> As long as life endures! That is a certainty, as gradually, while practising <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vipassanā</span>, I feel better and better with what I think. I do believe that there is nothing to do in the life of the laity, I do not believe that I will ever be able to return to it. There should occur an earthshaking change for that, but it is a pale prospect.</p>
<p>In the lay life, there is nothing. There are only pointless distractions. Always the very same worries do occur. Sometimes, we have some amusement for one or two hours. Then, worries come back. It is always the same process. We don't have enough money, not enough of this, not enough of that. We are always intending to get more, more, more. Moreover, we never achieve the "more".</p>
<p><img class="imag" alt="10 monks integrate the new monk in the samgha" title="Recitation of the kammavācā, by means of which it is proper to integrate the new monks into the samgha." src="../ph/em8.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Did you study Buddha's teaching before coming here?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> No, I was brought up into a Buddhist family. I sometimes went along with them for attending a few ceremonies, but I never drew any inspiration out of it. My interest for Buddha's teaching started to simultaneously grow with the development of a few reflections I had when I was young, around the age of eleven onward. Then, little by little, it grew in importance, no desire holds attraction to me. By listening to the talks of some monks, I ascertained that their words perfectly corresponded with my ideas. For that very reason, I decided to commit myself to that path.</p>
<p><img class="imad" alt="The new monk bring his first offerings" title="Sīla Vanta has just received his first offerings:some soap, some laundry powder, a towel, some camphor oil and a fruit juice." src="../ph/em9.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Do you succeed in observing the monastic discipline?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> I will try my best to observe it in the best possible way. I am very rigorous on these issues. Buddha never called whomsoever in his community. We join it because we want to. If we choose coming into it, we must observe a right conduct, we are liable to respect Buddha's word, quite simply.</p>
<p><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Is this discipline not too difficult for you?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> I put it into practice without asking further questions. Monastic discipline is likened to traffic rules. If everybody follows them, there is no problem. The monk who does not respect the <span class="pit" title="monastic discipline" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> (monastic discipline) is in danger.</p>
<p><img class="imag" alt="The monk Sīla Vanta in meditation posture at the foot of a big tree" title="The only thing that remains to be done is turning our attention to physical and mental phenomena , up to nibbāna." src="../ph/em10.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>What do you do nowadays?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> I just started a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vipassanā</span> retreat.</p>
<p><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>What are your future plans?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> I have no plans in mind. For the moment, I note (I turn my attention to mental and physical phenomena), that's all! (Laughters).</p>
<p><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Which is your most precious aim?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">MSV:</span> To free myself from all suffering.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----2">Nuns' discipline</h2>
<h4>Interview with the nun Nanda Mālā</h4>
<p><img alt="Groupe de nonnes" title="Group of nuns reciting wishes addressed to donors." src="../ph/en1.jpg" /></p>
<p><span class="rem">DhammaDāna.org :</span> <strong>There is no <span class="pit" title="monastic discipline" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> designed for nuns (<span class="pit" title="who observe the precepts" xml:lang="pi">sīladhara</span>). Nevertheless, are you liable to observe a code of discipline?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">Nonne Nanda Mālā :</span> We can observe up to 8, 9 or 10 precepts, according to our choice, and it is up to the capacities or wish of each of us. The 9th of the 9 precepts, is meant for dedicating oneself to develop <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">metta</span>, benevolent love towards all beings, in every possible way.</p>
<p><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Apart from the 8, 9 or 10 precepts, do you have other points of training?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">NNM:</span> There can be others; we can, if we wish so, and according to our capacity, practise one or several <span class="pit" title="ascetic practices" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>. Nevertheless, we cannot practise the 13 <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>. Owing to the fact that we are women, only half of them are accessible to us. We are not eligible for practising the others, as they pose major difficulties to a woman. Examples: <span class="pit" title="training consist to dwell in a cemetery" xml:lang="pi">susānika dhutaṅga</span> or <span class="pit" title= "training consist to dwell under a tree" xml:lang="pi">rukkhamūlika dhutaṅga</span>. Regarding <span class="pit" title="training consist to dwell in a forest monastery" xml:lang="pi">āraññika dhutaṅga</span>, a nun is not authorised to dwell in a forest alone, as she would expose herself to too many dangers. On the other hand, a group of nuns is authorised to practise this <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span>.</p>
<p>In the same way as monks (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>), nuns do not all have similar dispositions. Some dedicate themselves to the study of scriptures, others to meditation, others even, to the practice of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>, each according to her skills. Some nuns only have in mind the idea to practise without respite until the stage of <span class="pit" title="the one succeed in eradication of mental impurities" xml:lang="pi">arahanta</span>. Some are very skilful in <span class="pit" title="study of dhamma" xml:lang="pi">pariyatti</span>, others in <span class="pit" title="practice of dhamma" xml:lang="pi">paṭipatti</span>. The ones who are very strongly inclined to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">paṭipatti</span> have a natural tendency to easily observe phenomena that they do perceive. Owing to this fact, they are inclined to practise the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>. On the other hand, nuns who do not succeed in discriminating between perceived phenomena do not have the capacity to practise the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>.</p>
<p><img class="imag" alt="Nun reading a book" title="Young nun studying the texts of dhamma." src="../ph/en2.jpg" />There are nuns who study texts, who learn excerpts from Buddha's word by heart, who are very passionate in studying <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>. They are very fond of continuously developing <span class="pit" title="good deeds" xml:lang="pi">kusalas</span>. Some specific nuns train into purifying their <span class="pit" title="virtue, life conduct" xml:lang="pi">sīla</span> through observance of the 9 or 10 precepts, by practising the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>, by abstaining from consuming meat, and so on. They try, to the best of their capabilities, to gather merit. There are also nuns who, enjoying loneliness, dwell alone inside of their room. Some want to be very well versed in the knowledge of texts, some give some teachings (to nuns and laity) to make the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> known.</p>
<p><img class="imad" alt="Two nuns under their umbrellas" title="Under their umbrellas, these two nuns have gone to receive some food and various objects, offered by the benefactors." src="../ph/en3.jpg" />I already came across nuns who practise the <span class="pit" title="monastic discipline" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> of the <span class="pit" title="female monks" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span>. I do have a great deal of respect for these nuns. Myself, however, I wished I could be a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunī</span> (if such thing was still possible) and I intend, one day, to follow that discipline. In the same way, I practise the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> every time I have an opportunity (like the fact to restrict oneself to a single meal per day and to eat out of only one vessel). On the other hand, if I am not in a good health, I am self-contented in only observing the 8 precepts, while studying and carrying out a missionary work (to impart the knowledge of <span class="pit" title="teaching of the reality" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> to others).</p>
<p><img class="livre" alt="Plastic nun, carrying a platter on the head" src="../ph/en4.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Are nuns sometimes going to collect their daily food among inhabited areas (the way monks do)?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">NNM:</span> Yes, but not every day, as the government does allow nuns to do it only twice a week; during the two days preceding every lunar day (which exactly amounts 8 times per lunation).</p>
<p><img class="imad" alt="Line of nuns" title="Often, nuns stand in long queue for going to receive their offerings." src="../ph/en5.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Why are they not authorised to go collecting their food every day?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">NNM:</span> Because many among them have a tendency towards greed. Owing to this fact, they would spend their whole day doing only this. They would thus no longer dedicate much time to the practice and the study of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>. Many nuns are women who have been married, who have experienced family life. Thus, being used to take a walk outside for long, they may easily have the tendency to spend time in making their collection. If it was so, people's devotion may rapidly fade away. That's why, following a request made by the government, the national council of the <span class="pit" title="monastic community" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> has published an official book into which do appear all the rules that nuns are liable to observe. Notably, it is specified that they should go collecting their food only twice a week, and to train into the practice and the study of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>.</p>

<p><img class="imag" alt="Nun receiving rice" title="Contrarily to the bhikkhus, the nuns received row rice" src="../ph/en6.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Why are monks, on their behalf, authorised to go daily in search of their food? Do they never display greedy attitudes?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">NNM:</span> Their discipline is much stricter. Among other things, they are not authorised to cook their own meal (nor to accept money). The luckiest among them &ndash; thanks to their previous <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kusalas</span> (numerous meritorious actions performed in the past), will daily benefit with a meal offered on the site. For the largest number of them, daily collection is the only means to provide for their needs.</p>
<p>We cannot compare the life of a monk with the one of a nun. We can nevertheless compare it with the life of a fully ordained nun (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunī</span>). The fully ordained nuns had, as the monks did, to follow a very extended kind of discipline, but that vocation got extinct so long ago from now. Soon or later, the male <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> will undergo the same kind of fate. Only recently did nuns swarm in large numbers. I think that for this reason too, they do not constitute a reliable vehicle for spreading (and preserving) the <span class="pit" title="Buddha's teaching" xml:lang="pi">sāsana</span>. That's why their status enjoys much less consideration.</p>
<p><img class="imad" alt="Nun cooking" title="The nuns cook for themselves." src="../ph/en7.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>Twice a month, monks join together to listen to the <span class="pit" title="set of the 227 main monastic rules" xml:lang="pi">pātimokkha</span> every lunar day, novices (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇera</span>) take back the 10 precepts. In the same way, are nuns regularly reminded of the conduct they have to observe?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">NNM:</span> Not exactly. Let us say that most of nuns back up with the lunar days while thinking within themselves: " Today, that's a lunar day, let us take benefit from such a day so as to strive for developing as much <span class="pit" title="goog deeds" xml:lang="pi">kusalas</span> as possible ! " or " let us cultivate a pure conduct! " etc. If some nuns tend to easily develop anger, they seize this opportunity for striving to abstain from it. But all this &ndash; contrarily to what does apply to monks &ndash; is not subject to an established procedure. It is a mere outcome of the devotion of each among them. We are not liable to regularly take back our precepts. That is up to each nun to do what she deems most fit.</p>
<p><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>If a monk commits a <span class="pit" title="group of the most serious faults for the monks" xml:lang="pi">pārājika</span>, he loses his status as a monk, and if a novice transgresses one of the first five among the 10 precepts, he loses his status (until taking back his precepts). In the same way, are there not faults for which a nun loses her status?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">NNM:</span> No, there is no severe restriction of this kind that does apply to nuns. Nuns' life style essentially enables them to develop some <span class="pit" title="maturity on the plan of the wisdom" xml:lang="pi">parāmīs</span> and some <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kusalas</span> by observing the 8 or 9 precepts, and to purify their conduct (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīla</span>).</p>
<p><img class="imag" alt="Nuns eating their lunch" title="As the monks, nuns don't eat at the same table with laities" src="../ph/en8.jpg" /><span class="rem">DD:</span> <strong>How to become a nun? Is will power sufficient for it?</strong></p>
<p><span class="rem">NNM:</span> One must have the will to be a nun. One must observe at least 8 precepts. For many women who choose to become a nun, it is very difficult, because they are used to do a lot of things that they are all of a sudden liable to refrain from. For some women, it is very difficult to proceed from the observance of 5 precepts up to 10. For example, from one day to the next, they should no longer listen to music, neither watch videos, nor eat at evening time (renounce to their make up and to all their jewelleries).</p>
<p>This existence proves to be very difficult for nuns who are but a little devoted to religious life. As many women have got attached to their head of hair, it is very hard for them to have to shave them off when they take the nun's robe. I have often met some who felt strongly nostalgic about their lay life, some often sang and they cruelly missed doing it. Nuns are liable to wake up at four o'clock in the morning (in most of nuns' convents), which creates another difficulty for some of them.</p>
<p>Thus, many women find it hard to endure this life style. On the other hand, others, who developed more <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">parāmīs</span>, finds no inconvenience at all leading this kind of life.</p>
