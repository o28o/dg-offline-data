<h1 id="_"><span id="titre">The laity practice (1)</span></h1>(definition, maturity, behaviors)<br />
<p><img class="imad" alt="little girl with radiant face" src="../../ph/dh01.jpg" /></p>
<h2 id="ch-----1">Definition</h2>
<h3>What does the practice lie in?</h3>
<p class="let">In the context of <span class="pit" title="path of the right knowledge of the reality" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, what we usually call "practice" is not an exercise or a ritual that ought to be performed at some particular times, but simply a training into a life style, a mode of existence, during which our mind gets little by little used to lessen its impurities, until a right knowledge of reality will be developed.</p>
<p>When we speak about Buddha, we consequently speak about "Buddhist practice". The one who adopts a life style that befits the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> teachings will therefore be a "Buddhist". It is advisable indeed to define this word.</p>
<h3>Who is a Buddhist?</h3>
<p>In no wise is a "Buddhist" the follower of a mystic ritual or some marginal movement that lives apart from the rest of the society, which requires a conversion. Even though, nowadays, many persons who claim to be Buddhists have life styles and embrace customs that drastically go astray from all that which originally defined this term, the "Buddhist" is only a person who lives in harmony with the teachings of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>. If our father is named Peter, if he gives us advices and if we put these advices into practice, at this moment we shall be "Peterist". Also, we shall be "Jenniferist" when we shall follow the advices of our mother Jennifer. In the same way, a "Buddhist" is no one else than the one who puts into practices a life style that is in harmony with Buddha's teaching.</p>
<p>It is not about a practice that we integrate from time to time into our daily lives, which we integrate when we have a bit of "spare time" to be spent for it. It is not even a kind of activity that would take part into our leisure activities, in the same way as ballet dance or archery might do. That is our whole life, indeed, up to the most insignificant details of our daily lives, which we take as stand points of our practice. So, "Buddhist" practice essentially lies in a way of life that one puts into practice or than one instead tries to put into practice, because this training is after all a permanent attempt. We try every day, every moment, according to the effort that we want indeed to put into it, to perfect this training in line with life, by striving to reduce and to avoid what is impure, unhealthy, useless and unfavourable, and by keeping on developing and maintaining what is pure, healthy, useful and beneficial.</p>
<p>Therefore it is equally absurd to assert: "I am a Buddhist but I am not a practising Buddhism" as to claim: "I am a vegetarian, but I eat meat".</p>
<h3>The laymen</h3>
<h4>The laymen and the others</h4>
<p>From the point of view of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, there are two categories of persons: Those who adhere to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, that is to say those who rely on Buddha's teaching; and those who do not adhere to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>.</p>
<p>Among those that do not adhere to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, whether we deal with followers of a religion or not, whether we deal with followers of a school of thought or not, one finds all the persons who adopt one or several beliefs among the group of those that exist apart from <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>.</p>
<p>As an example, the simple fact to think that nothing does remain whatsoever after death, is a kind of belief in the same way as any other is.</p>
<p>In this group, we find monks and nuns, who totally dedicate themselves to the practice suggested by their respective doctrines so as to reach the goal that these one assert.</p>
<p>We find hermits, who isolate themselves in remote places to observe an ascetic mode of existence. They do it so as to reach the purpose that is supposed to get training proposed by their own faith. Those do not belong to any religious school.</p>
<p>We find "priests" and "priestesses", who are relatively involved into the suggested or imposed practice by the teachings in connection with their faith, and who organise or direct the practice of the laymen.</p>
<p>Finally, we find laymen, who, according to the individual cases, adhere to a religion, to a school of thought (philosophy, sect, etc.) or only to their own ideas. In the first two cases, they do it by devoting themselves to religious or ritual practices, ceremonies, recitations, prayers, considerations,philosophic debates, or by being self-contented with beliefs in ideas expounded by a monk, a guru, a philosopher, a book or any another support. In the last case (layman adhering to his own ideas), he shapes his own way to be followed, according to the faiths, or he believes that what does occur after the death is the same thing for all, whatever are the actions being performed prior to it (Examples: Rebirths do occur in a totally unpredictable way; everybody is reborn in a realm of paradise or blissful celestial world (or demoniac); everybody reaches the stage of the divinity; before and after life, only nothingness does prevail, as soon as one dies, nothing whatsoever does remain; etc.)</p>

<a href="laity.htm#"><img class="navtb" src="../../im/navtop.gif" alt="Top of page" title="To the top of page" /></a><a href="laity.htm#hrpied"><img class="navtb" src="../../im/navbas.gif" alt="Bottom of page" title="To the bottom of page" /></a>
	</div>
<p>This type of belief is one of the most wide-spread, it explains why so many persons live so selfishly by enjoying pleasant things, which they get access to, to the full, by radically running away from all that which seems to be unpleasant, devoid of pleasure or boring.</p>
<p>Among those who adhere to <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, there are <span class="pit" title="monk of the community established by Buddha" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>, whom we often call the "Buddhist monks". They fully devote all their time to the practice, to the realisation, to the study and to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> teachings.</p>
<p>There were <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span>, "Buddhist nuns", who did exactly the same thing, but their community disappeared since the 10th century, at the same time as <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sikkhamānas</span>, who were women of intermediate status between <span class="pit" title="novice girl" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇerīs</span> and <span class="pit" title="full ordonained nun" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span>, also did. They were in period of training, intending to become <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span>.</p>
<p>There are <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇeras</span>, whom we call "novices" or the "little monks". They learn monastic life, they dress in the monks' robe, but their discipline is sharply more flexible than those of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>. To become <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>, they have to wait to reach twenty years of age.</p>
<p>There were <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇerīs</span>, feminine version of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇera</span>, whose presence vanished since the end of the feminine monastic community.</p>
<p>There are those whom we call the "nuns", who are women who opt for a monastic or semi-monastic existence. They do have a little particular status, halfway between the one of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> and the one of the laity. besides certain rules, they have to observe eight rules. Their life is dedicated to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, even though they perform many activities specific to the laity.</p>
<h4>Who is a lay person?</h4>
<p>Finally, among the people who adhere to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, all those who are not <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>, or <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇeras</span>, or nuns are laity. We can divide lay people into three categories:</p>
<ul class="liste">
<li>There are some laity who, although approving Buddha's word, only dedicate their life a little, or not at all, to the practice of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>. They like to claim that they are Buddhists, but do little else than run after pleasures and engage in business activities; if they observe one or two precepts, it is only because it is easy for them; they don't want to dedicate any effort to the rest. Even though they claim to be inclined to meditation, they convince themselves that they never have any time to practice it.</li>
<li>There are also lay people who try to dedicate more time and effort to follow a way suitable to the development of knowledge (of reality). They more or less observe the five precepts (sometimes the eight), they like everything that concerns the dhamma aesthetically (monuments, statues, ceremonies), they readily spend time reciting texts dealing with Buddha's teaching, watching the quality of their actions, regularly making donations, attending meditation sessions, and sometimes, taking ordination for a short period. </li>
<li>Finally, there are laity who, within their possibilities, try their best to progress quickly and effectively on the path to the cessation of suffering. These ones very regularly train in being generous, in being vigilant and in applying full mindfulness. Their observance of the five precepts, if not eight, is scrupulous. Some of them even intend to lead a monastic life permanently. </li>
</ul>
<p>Although they all point to a sole aim, the objectives of Buddha's teaching are very diverse. They consist, among others, in:</p>
<ul class="lfl">
<li>Inducing the first category of laity to improve their way of life so as to become laity of the second category. </li>
<li>Encouraging the laity of the second category to maintain the positive aspects of their way of life and inciting them to improve on this so as to become laity of the third category. </li>
<li>Encouraging the laity of the third category to maintain the positive aspects of their way of life and suggesting them the experience of complete renunciation (monastic life). </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ch-----2">The pāramīs</h2>
<h3>kamma and the pāramīs</h3>
<p class="let">In a prison cell lived four men. The first was ignorant and lazy, the second was ignorant and hard working, the third was skilful and lazy, and the fourth was skilful and hard working. Each had the possibility to work and earn a little money.</p>
<p>The lazy ignoramus had a thoroughly miserable existence; he did nothing at all during the day, was terribly bored and never obtained anything more than the bare minimum for his subsistence.</p>
<p>The hard-working ignoramus enjoyed a more comfortable life, because his work allowed him extra food and small treats such as a bottle of wine or magazines.</p>
<p>The skilful lazy person did not have a very pleasant existence. As he did not put any effort in his work, he did not earn the money needed to buy things that would have allowed him to enjoy a better quality of life. However, knowing how to think, he suffered less than the lazy ignoramus, because he knew how to manage his condition better. Thus, he succeeded more easily in being satisfied with little. However, his incorrigible laziness eventually prevented him from thinking properly.</p>
<p>The skilful worker was competent in his work. Knowing how to think properly, he knew how to manage his money wisely. He learnt to content himself with little to save most of the money he earned. He had nothing good to drink or eat, or pleasant readings to offer himself. Nevertheless, after a while, having endured the necessary time, he was able to pay off the bail to get out of prison.</p>
<p>To make the analogy of this story, we can say that:</p>
<p>The prison represents the continual dissatisfaction of existence (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dukkha</span>), with its "ups and downs", the cycle of rebirths (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃsarā</span>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Ignorance represents ignorance.</li>
<li>Skill represents wisdom.</li>
<li>Laziness represents the lack of motivation to cultivate wholesome actions.</li>
<li>Work represents effort (the effort to develop and maintain what is beneficial, the effort to practice properly).</li>
<li>The money represents the consequence of positive actions, merit (<span class="pit" title="good deed" xml:lang="pi">kusala</span>).</li>
<li>The release represents liberation (from any form of dissatisfaction).</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="rem">Conclusion:</span> To develop merit, it is necessary to perform positive actions, to make efforts of generosity, honesty and concentration.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if this is done with ignorance, merit will be badly used and, so to speak, "wasted". Thus, it remains profitless. For this merit to be beneficial, it must be cultivated with wisdom, that is, positive actions should be performed with the intention to take care of and develop the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> (for one's own progress and that of others).</p>
<p><span class="rem">Comment:</span> More than positive actions, the more profitable actions are simply abstinences from destructive or worthless actions.</p>
<p>This explains why it is essential to understand clearly the actions that we perform and know how we have to carry them out if we wish them to be really profitable.</p>
<p>The prison story also shows us that wisdom is useless without effort, which is indispensable for the development of wisdom. Thus, only the development of <span class="pit" title="maturity on the plan of the wisdom" xml:lang="pi">pāramīs</span> does allow us to progress on the path to liberation, at whatever level one may be.</p>
<p>If someone benefits from all the elements which allow him (her) to make of his (her) existence a training in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> (birth as human being, in a favourable environment, in a place and time when the teaching of a Buddha (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāsana</span>) is accessible, understanding the value of such a training, urge to embark in it, lack of serious obstacles such as a poor health, etc.), this means that he (she) has already developed numerous <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pāramīs</span> in the past. If, besides these conditions, someone devotes himself (herself) with ease to "meditation" (training into <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">satipaṭṭhāna</span>), it means that he (she) has developed even more <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pāramīs</span>. If a person opts for the life of renunciation by joining, in a most natural way, the monastic community (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>), it means that even more <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pāramīs</span> have been developed. Finally, when our <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pāramīs</span> reach complete maturity, we cannot but experience <span class="pit" title="the way wich lead to the liberation" xml:lang="pi">nibbāna</span>, the cessation of all suffering.</p>

<h3>The ten pāramīs</h3>
<p>Buddha gave us a list of the ten <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pāramīs</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāna pāramī</span>: Abandonment of possessions (animals or non-living objects) by making donations. </li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīla pāramī</span>: Control of actions and speech to avoid unwholesome actions. </li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nekkhamma pāramī</span>: Renunciation of the lay life in favour of the solitary life (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>, hermit). </li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pañña pāramī</span>: Development of knowledge and understanding through study and analytical reflection. To teach knowledge to others. To use one's wisdom for a maximum of benefits. </li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">viriya pāramī</span>: Effort to work as much as possible for the good of others, even at the risk of one's life. </li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">khantī pāramī</span>: Establishment of an always perfect tolerance, irrespective of the actions and words of others towards oneself. </li>

<h2 id="ch-----3">Love and benevolence</h2>
<h3>Towards whom to develop love?</h3>
<p class="let">If we wish to progress on the path, it is essential to develop <span class="pit" title="loving kindness" xml:lang="pi">mettā</span>. The love in question is an unlimited love that encompasses all beings, whatever they are. As we can read in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mettā sutta</span> (discourse on loving kindness), it consists of developing <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mettā</span> towards all beings, humans as well as animals, those we know as well as those we do not know, those we see as well as those we do not see, those that are pleasant as well as those that are hostile, those that are close as well as those that are far, those that are small as well as those that are big, etc.</p>
<p>Naturally, one does not need a lot of effort to practice <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mettā</span>, benevolence and tolerance, towards those who are dear to him (her). However, when the question arises as to apply it towards those who cause us trouble, those who act badly towards us, those who commit only hateful and unwholesome actions, it becomes more difficult. It is precisely this difficulty that gives us the opportunity to progress on the path of wisdom. It is exactly the same with meditation: When everything is well, when everything is comfortable, when there is no pain, no itch, when it is not too warm or too cold and when silence is total, we feel well, assured, but we shall have no opportunity to progress correctly.</p>
<h3>How to practise mettā and benevolence?</h3>
<p>As with anything in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, we could begin to develop <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mettā</span>, benevolence and tolerance, gradually. For this, it is simply sufficient to get used to cultivate, from time to time, a state of benevolence towards one or several beings, to strive to send <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mettā</span> mentally to someone who behaves badly towards us, to tolerate as far as possible an action that displeases us, whether committed voluntarily or not.</p>
<p>Or still, we suppress those prejudices that we could easily have when seeing someone having a bizarre attitude, and pay attention for a few moments, to notice possibly that this person is anguished, ill-at-ease, and apparently leading a painful existence. At that time, it will be natural to develop feelings of compassion and benevolence towards this person. If he (she) is sensitive and if he meets our glance, he (she) will see immediately that we show him sincere affection, he (she) will be able to feel less rejected and benefit from a positive mood. If there is a chance, we could even engage in a conversation with him (her), talking about simple things which may eventually be linked with him (her), and which could be a precious help to him (her).</p>
<p>For a generalised practice of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mettā</span> and benevolence, we begin for example with our close relations, the members of our family and our friends, then we gradually expand, including at first our neighbours, our work colleagues, our companions in study, sports or any group. We then add all the beings that we meet. For example, when on a bus, we can occasionally spend a short while to develop thoughts of benevolence towards all those who are in the vehicle. We continue by including all the beings in the village, district or city, without forgetting the mosquitoes that sting us! Then, all the beings of the country, and finally, those on the planet and the whole universe.</p>
<h3>Prayers</h3>
<p>To develop the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pāramīs</span> , many of us who do not feel able to follow a training into concentration, such as the application of attention to physical and mental perceptions (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">satipaṭṭhāna</span>), could more or less regularly devote time to the practice of mettā and benevolence by means of prayer. To do this, we recite a sutta dealing with <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mettā</span> , benevolence and compassion. While reciting them, we close the eyes and concentrate on the words we pronounce. Such a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sutta</span> recited in a group, can provide support not only to develop <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mettā</span>, benevolence or compassion more easily and more enduringly, but also some concentration that will be greatly beneficial for the cultivation of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pāramīs</span>. Naturally, for this to be effective, these prayers must be recited with an understanding of what is said, or at least with an idea of what the texts in question say (otherwise the value is lesser), and to concentrate on this, avoiding to let the mind wander somewhere else. It is important to do this wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>If we want this practice to bear fruit, it is necessary also to try to preserve the same state of mind at the beginning and after the prayers. Similarly, one must try to remain tranquil for at least a few moments before the prayers, in order to have the mind well attuned. Ideally one should keep this state of mind at all times, so that the time of prayer is only a focusing permitting to maintain an almost permanent state of benevolence.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----4">One's relations to others</h2>
<p class="let">Buddha showed to us how to reach the definitive cessation of any form of dissatisfaction. Before reaching it, the path is long, it requires for each of us to perfect at all levels, beginning from the base, otherwise how could we build anything on impure bases? Let us feel reassured, the Buddha does not forget anybody; he explains, giving invaluable details, how every person has to act if he/she wishes to benefit from an existence that is as profitable as possible for oneself and for others, regardless of the social milieu and position in society.</p>
<p>He explains, among other things, how to manage a business or how a king (or a head of state) should act towards his people, and all, quite naturally, with the aim of establishing an ideal for all in terms of human relations and mutual respect, and, consequently, to offer everyone a framework suitable for training in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>. Thus, below, the duties of one to others according to the Buddha, for anyone wishing to lead his life in the most noble and the most profitable way, that of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>.</p>
