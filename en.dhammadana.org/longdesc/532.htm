<strong>longdesc</strong>: Five young monks and novices are studying, with books, each one is sat in a different corner of the big room in witch they are inside. The floor est flat and varnished.In the middle, a guided cullumn with a red base paint. On the left, a wood stair. At the end on the right, old cupboards. The red colors of the monk's robes and the wood looks hotter because of hidded light of the sunset.</font>
