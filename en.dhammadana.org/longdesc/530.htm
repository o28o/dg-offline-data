<strong>title</strong>: Tenasserim &ndash; Small &quot;one place&quot; monastery lost in the tranquillity of the woods, only fifteen minutes away from the nearest village. Ideal for the monk who wishes to be delivered from the insane effervescence of the life in society. Those interested should hurry up, because this vihƒÅra , which is of course without rent, is still free...<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Little accomodation of wood made on a down forest It roof is dry leeves made.. A part is wthout walls. Only a groud pot is visible in this little house.</font>
