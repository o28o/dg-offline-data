<strong>title</strong>: Loylem &ndash; Cold water shower. If a Burmese person &ndash; except rich or having travelled abroad &ndash; perceives a double tap &quot;western style&quot;, one red and the other blue, he will not seize its significance. Cold water is the only thing with which a monk is permitted to feed himself without being offered.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Monk taking his shower. We see him droping water on the body with a plastic backet. During the mouvment, the water witch recover totally the head of the monk give the feeling to be a invisible plastic bag. Behind, we can see his robe let on bamboo and trees.</font>
