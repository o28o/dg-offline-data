<strong>title</strong>: Seno &ndash; Young novice taking a bath.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: A young novice has only a piece of tissu around his waist. He's shawering; water falls down from his body appearing in relief by the sunset and witch the skin is guildy. He's holding a plastic bowl witch helps him to take water from a big ground pot. At the top of his robe, and at the back, banana trees along a bamboo fence.</font>
