<strong>title</strong>: Mandalay &ndash; Here is the National Pali University of Mandalay, where approximately 350 monks live. This vast monastery-university shelters many great scholars among the professors (monks) who teach the dhamma to other monks. In addition to its study halls, its more than thirty residential buildings, its remarkable sima and its large &quot;dhamma hall&quot;, one finds here a library, a vast dining room and administrative buildings attached to the ministry of religious affairs.<br /><br />
