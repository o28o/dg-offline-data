<strong>title</strong>: Yangon &ndash; Group of young novices.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: A group of  eight young novices focusing the objective. They are carelessly installed on a small wood seat. Three are standing behind and one is crouching down on the side. We are in front of a small entrance of a stall that we can see a pannel proposing cold drinks (in Burmese language). The place is a small desert road, where coconuts and other trees are hiding houses.</font>
