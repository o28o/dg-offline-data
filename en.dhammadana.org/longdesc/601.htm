<strong>title</strong>: Mingun &ndash; If this bloc of ruined bricks is famous, it' s because the base should have been the the biggest pagoda of the world. The big fissure was made by a earthtake in the XIXth century. Because of the old stair recently built on the outside, we can climb on it.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Massive block of ruined bricks, with a fissure all over. This block, was supposed to become a giant pagoda, has almost a cubic form; It is at least smaller on the hight. The all is ground colored (because of the bricks), only a big door made of stone is from a shining white. The sky, of a stong and clear blue, put in value the old edifice.</font>
