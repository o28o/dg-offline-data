<strong>title</strong>: Loylem &ndash; The &quot;dhamma hall&quot;, which is the largest building in most monasteries. It's in this room where the teachings are delivered to laymen and where different ceremonies are held.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Big room of a small monastery, used for meditation and ceremonials. The building is white and green, and is very extended. Up to the entrance, we see two pieces of roofs together and under the main roof. The front is concreted and goes lightly down. Behind, we can see the beginning of a forest.</font>
