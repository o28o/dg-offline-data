<strong>title</strong>: Yangon &ndash; One of the impressive bell located in front of the entrance of the cave, guarded by four snake dragons.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Big plan on a heavy old bell, hanged on a cover in concrete white and gold painted. Around it and along the two collumns maintaining the cover, four white snake dragons with their green tail going up. Their barb is black, and their mane and the end of their tail ore guilded. At the back, we see a part of of a big artificial cave, belonged with exotic trees well growned.</font>
