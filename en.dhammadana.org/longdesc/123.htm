<strong>title</strong>: Kyay Thi Yo &ndash; The famous Golden Rock.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Big view on the enormous golden rock of Kyay Thi Yo, where we see clearly it charateristic impressive balance. A large fissure permit to see the sky behind the rock. The part where it touchs the ground is very reduce; it seems to be at the limit of falling down. On the left, a montainous valley forest covered, on the right, we guess people doing their devotions, and down, are pointing paper decorations, offered regiliousely on the place.</font>
