<strong>title</strong>: Inwa &ndash; Monastery dating from the XIX th &ndash; or even the XVIII th &ndash; century. Despite it's wooden structure, including the large cylindrical pillars which support it, it's in a remarkable state of conservation. Even though it has become a tourist visit, this monastery is still inhabited by monks.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Detail of a very old monastery made with sculpted wood. What we see is a part of the fence going around the old building. It is almost filled of wood, letting only a little empty space. The principals motifs are peacocks with large feathers. On the right side, a monastic robe is let on the fence.</font>
