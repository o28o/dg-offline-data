<strong>title</strong>: Yangon &ndash; The vast and famous Mahāsī meditation centre of Yangon. The monks wait the sound of the drum to go to have their lunch.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Long file of monks, staights, standing, with sandals, the bowl aroud the shoulder and a tissu on this same shoulder. They are waiting in silence the meal bell. Only, a monk is outside of this file; he's walking on the right, covered by an umbrella. He seems to be a head file monk.</font>
