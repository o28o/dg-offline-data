<strong>title</strong>: Tenasserim &ndash; We are still in the same centre, surrounded by the woods and the mountains, not close nor far from the village. The place is totally silent, the only sound is that of the cocks, giving their deafening concert at four o'clock in the morning. It doesn't matter the meditators have already gotten up. We can observe monks walking plunged in the contemplation of vipassanƒÅ.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Flat place in a meditation center. In the middle, cocks eating seeds. On the sides, are growing young trees, and around, we see flats made of wood on glass pilotis. In front of those individual flats, monks absorbed in their meditation walk.</font>
