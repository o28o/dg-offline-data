<strong>title</strong>: Mandalay &ndash; These monks, who are rare to have access to data processing, write books on the dhamma (translations, comments, teachings, etc), or more often, satisfy themselves by seizing the manuscripts of monks scholars who prefer writing with a feather.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Three Burmese monks, each one of them is working on a computer, tipping. We are in a small room, the computers (ans on handy) are fixed on simple tables made of wood. At the back we see cartons, a ventilator and robes.</font>
