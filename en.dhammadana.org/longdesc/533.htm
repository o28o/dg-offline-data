<strong>title</strong>: Pakokku &ndash; Here we can see the largest sīmā in Myanmar. This concerns a building very representative of monastic constructions of the beginning of the XX th century: solid mass, with thick walls, with an external balcony which makes it possible to walk all around it. However the most populated monastery in the country is in Mandalay: My Soyein Tait Thit, near to the three thousand monks.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Massive monastic building with many stairs. The two downstairs have on entrance for each(one on the other) with a cover of a stair roof.</font>
