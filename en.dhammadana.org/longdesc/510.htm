<strong>title</strong>: Loylem &ndash; Welcome in the Shan State, a vast fresh region &ndash; located on a plate &ndash; with authentic traditions still reign. Loylem is located in a zone where foreigners are not allowed. We can see here a novice laying out his robes which he just washed.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: A novice put down a robe close to two others, allready down on a long bamboo, for drying under the sun. A big tree is showing at the back.</font>
