<strong>longdesc</strong>: General view of the Shwedagon Pagoda platform. On the right appears the base of the pagoda, obscures by pigtails for scaffolding use. All around of the large marble way witch makes the turn of it, are raising little pagodas; some are covered of fine gold, some others made in scuplted wood, and again, painted of Indians full colors fresco. On the platform, stroll along people coming for devotions or simply for visiting the place.</font>
