<strong>title</strong>: Pakokku &ndash; We have travelled to the heart of the country. The toilets are generally built according to this model, in the monasteries: a pit, above which is a wooden cube with a hole in the bottom, and a sheet of iron on the top. Inside, invariably a terra cotta pot containing the cleaning water (valid also for the basin, when there is one around the hole of them), with a plastic or aluminium bowl.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Toilets in a little wood house covered with a four down metal roof. The door is wide open, but the shadow is hiding the holl made in the middle. Just on the side, a palm tree with his branchs on the little house.</font>
