<strong>title</strong>: Mandalay &ndash; In this monastery where studying is the main occupation, these novices learn on the floor the teachings delivered by their master. In the morning with their bowl, they collect their meal which is often limited to rice and some vegetables.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: First on the right, High seated, in front of a open book on a wood table, a old monk is teatching Bouddhism to an asssembly of monks. At the back, we see a room full of monks, pen in hand, writting during the old monk is talking. The pale and blue walls of the room are made with a door and windows in witch the daylight comes in.</font>
