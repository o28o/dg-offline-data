<strong>title</strong>: Maulmyein &ndash; On the hills dominating the valley, extending a real city of religious edifices in all styles. Joined by decorated stairs, those temples and pagodas seems to make a labyrhint without end, but so remarquable that we lose ourself with pleasure.<br /><br />
<strong>longdesc</strong>: Way down and going up until a hill showing a big guided pagoda. Not far from here a painted door in a pink and gold style crossing the alley. This one is belonging with a stair covered by netal roofs. The front hill seems covered of roof stairs buildings. Many coconut trees appears.</font>
