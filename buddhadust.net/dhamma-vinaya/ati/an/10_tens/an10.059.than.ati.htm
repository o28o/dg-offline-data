					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The perceptions of inconstancy, not-self, unattractiveness, drawbacks, abandoning, dispassion, and cessation are explained in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p60">AN 10:60</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Samañca visamañca:</i> Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people and actions. Dissonant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments, metaphors for good. In Pali, the term <i><a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xsama-3">sama</a></i>, "even," described an instrument tuned on-pitch; <i>visama</i>,"uneven," an instrument off-pitch. There is a famous passage (<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p55">AN 6:55</a>) where the Buddha reminds Soṇa Koḷivisa — who had been over-exerting himself in the practice — that a lute sounds appealing only if the strings are neither too taut nor too lax, but "evenly" tuned. This image would have special resonances with the Buddha's teaching on the middle way. It also adds meaning to the term <i>samaṇa</i> — monk or contemplative — which the texts frequently mention as being derived from <i>sama.</i>See also <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p97">MN 97</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i><a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xloka">Loka</a>:</i> The term "world" here should be understood in line with the definition given in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm#p82">SN4.35.82</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The conclusion here is identical with the conclusion of the descriptions of the practice of establishing mindfulness in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">DN 22</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p10">MN 10</a>.</p>
