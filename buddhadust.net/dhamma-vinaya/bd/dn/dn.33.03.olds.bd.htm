					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>X-saṅkappā, X-saññā X-dhātu.</i> (Suttas 7-12) I think in this set of six sets of terms we are being given a look-see into a very deep and not at all usual way of seeing the world. Starting with perceptions, our ordinary way is to think of ourselves as passive recipients of perception. Ordinarily we think of skill with regard to perception as "one has accurate or inaccurate perceptions and the more accurate the more skillful." But here we are being asked to understand that to have a perception of a certain nature is either skillful or unskillful. In other words, we are being told that perception is a matter of intent.<br />
					There is the case (see: <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/sitting_practice/powers_ofthe_aristocrats.htm">The Powers of the Aristocrats</a>) where perception is a matter of will: "... he is able to wish: 'let me perceive the ugly in the beautiful, the beautiful in the ugly, etc." And this would also fit in with the understanding of the transmutation of <i>vedana</i> depending on one's mental set with regard to being a part of the world (see discussion at <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/feelings.htm">dhamma_talk/feelings.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Then, if perception is a matter of will or intent, it is not too difficult to see that there must be available to the perceiver at the outset both skillful and unskillful characteristics <i>(dhatu)</i> from which to choose, so that is covered.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">From there we can understand that <i>sankappas</i> (having X as a main objective in one's life, my "principles" others "aims" or more broadly, our intents, priorities and purposes based on our point of view) direct the mind towards skillful or unskillful characteristics which when contacted by sense-organ will produce skillful or unskillful perceptions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">One more thing to factor in: The renunciation characteristic / principle / perception. Given that perception is based on characteristics, characteristics are necessarily finite. The finite exists within the infinite and therefore there would need to be a characteristic which represented the interface (or it would be like one was either locked onto the infinite or the finite and could not escape ... there needs to be an characteristic that allows for detachment ... I imagine a set of wires connected to a bomb; one can choose wires that produce a friendly explosion or ones that choose an unfriendly explosion, or the one that defuses the bomb.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The danger here is clear: one must at all costs avoid the conclusion that because one is able to direct perception and that consequently one's world is clearly of one's own making, that one therefore has a self somewhere in either the creative forces or the results.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In the discussion groups on the web the term "accumulations" is thrown around very liberally, connected with all sorts of <i>kamma,</i> and with the implication that the predominant mode of <i>kamma</i> is the fixed sort.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">I think a very good case can be made that below the extra-ordinary level most deeds fall into the uncertain-outcome pile.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The factor determining outcome of a deed in terms of experience is the intent with which the deed is performed. There are deeds which are of such high profile that it would be impossible to perform them with mixed intent. Of this sort, what we have in the literature is one or two extraordinary deeds described as fixed in outcome: the murder of one's parents or of an arahant, the drawing of the blood of a <i>Tathāgata</i> with intent to injure, creating a schism in the <i>Saṅgha;</i> some extraordinary good deed done for the Buddha. For the rest it is just about as impossible to perform deeds <i>without</i> mixed intent.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">For a deed performed with mixed intent the outcome is determined by the point of view held at the time of fruition (or earlier in the case of one able to recall deeds done long ago). The 'repayment' or 'balancing' of accounts is accomplished for deeds by experience of the sensations created in the original act. These sensations can be experienced over a lengthy period of time or instantaneously and subjectively valued as 'bad' or 'good' depending on the point of view held with regard to them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">For example the experience of worry and anxiety connected with loss of wealth can be experienced as pleasant if the point of view taken is that this is a lesson in the perils of possession and the advantages of letting go and that the sensations are those of the ending of grasping after wealth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This is the lesson taught in the section of the <i>Satipaṭṭhana</i> connected with sensation where sensation is described as being of three sorts [painful, pleasant, and not-painful-but-not-pleasant] and of two modes [downbound to the world and not downbound to the world].</p>

He instances the conduct of Sāriputta in the <i>'Catuma Sutta,'</i> M.I, 459, explaining the latter's motive." (See <i>Majjhima</i> #67: PTS, MLS II:#67, pp:128; WP: pp560, which does not deal with the same situation). The point here is that some, having done a deed in the past, or being in the habit of doing such deeds in the present, feel the need to keep this behavior secret, and their close followers, who may be aware of the behavior, keep quiet about it to others.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">We have the recent example of the guru who claimed never to eat who was addicted to McDonald's hamburgers, whose secret eating habits were kept from exposure by his close followers. There is also the case of the Catholic Church hiding the child molesting behavior of some priests.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">What is being spoken of here is a freedom from feeling the need to guard against exposure, not freedom from possible exposure or criticism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Even the Buddhas face criticism: "They will criticize you when you do right and they will criticize you when you do wrong, and they will criticize you when you do nothing ..."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Certainly today there are those who would criticize and call immoral the Buddha's behavior in leaving his wife and child prior to becoming a <i>Tathāgata</i> (today [7/16/2002], in the USA, he could be subjected to fines and jailed for this!).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">While this freedom from feeling the need to guard is a natural consequence and attribute of Arahantship (because the Arahant has given up any ambitions with regard to the world), it could be the attribute of anyone who gave up the idea of acting on fear of exposure due to the need for wrongly earned fame or a false good reputation. — Having one's past bad or questionable behavior be exposed publicly could certainly be embarrassing, but knowledge of the possibility of embarrassment does not necessarily dictate any attempt to hide such or guard against exposure. (What it may do is make one a tad shy of fame, but short of Arahantship, this is not such a bad fear to have (see: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/sn/02_nv/sn02.17.001-043.olds.bd.htm">Fame, Favors and Gains</a>).</p>

In the <i>Pāḷi</i>, there is some slight emphasis on the act when <i>"kamma"</i> is used and some slight emphasis on the outcome when <i>"saṅkhāra"</i> is used. There is, in addition, a strong sense of "Identification with" associated with <i>"saṅkhāra."</i> To my mind <i>"saṅkhāra"</i> could well have been a word intended to clarify the idea that <i>kamma</i> was not just simply "action" but also the consequences thereof to an identified-with individuality, that is, that the results are Indentified-with. [This footnote is early (this sutta was one of the first I attempted) and in later translations this notion became a certainty that this term stood for the idea that the kamma involved is the intent to create personal experience through acts of body, speech and thought, that is, "own-making".</p>

Since the statement is: X: y-X; that would really result (meaning that their translations fudge the second half of the equation) for these translators in the statement: "Bases by merit accomplished: that of (composed of) giving based merit accomplished (<i>i.e.,</i> merit accomplished by giving, not a basis created by the merit of giving), which gives a different meaning for each half of the statement.

					<p class="lgqt">This makes good sense in terms of describing a spectrum of experience. Here at least, the distinction in the latter two can be understood in relation to the Hindu and Buddhist view that less is better. The gods of the <i>Abhassara</i> realm "stream radiance" and "utter sounds" while the gods of the Subha-kinna realm, being more refined, are "luminous" and don't resort to the utterance of sounds of joy. (In the days before the domination of the world by American Pop culture there used to be a similar phenomena observable in the contrast of the reactions to music of American and European youth: the American youth would move around in time to the music while the Europeans would sit perfectly still. The former, while holding themselves superior to the latter, actually fend off the full scope of the experience of the music by their reaction which substitutes the experience of themselves reacting to the music for the experience of the music, while the latter allowed the experience to pervade their beings.)</p>

Of or flowing from Indra. The usual "faculties," needs "... of Indra" or something that indicates that these are extra-ordinary, or god-like faculties (or, more accurately, faculties seen as godlike or wondrous). Woodward uses "controlling powers, faculties, and controlling faculties." The various <i>Indrianis</i> are all forces or attributes that are found under other categories. However when in the <i>Pāḷi</i> they are found under this heading they have a much more magical, super-normal connotation. Since the idea of Indra (a god of War and Wrath, much like, if not the same as Zeus and Jupiter) was largely replaced in the Buddhist culture by the idea of Sakka (a god of good deeds, respect for the elders, and a Streamwinner), I suspect that what we have in these "faculties" is a carry-over of an old set of power categories with the terms being redefined in the Buddhist sense possibly to make the transition more comprehensible for those of the older beliefs. In the <i>Samyutta</i> version of these three, the heading is <i>ñāya,</i> or "method" or "knack,"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Woodward (pp179): The Method<br />
					There are these three controlling faculties. What three?<br />
					The consciousness that 'I shall know the unknown,' the consciousness of gnosis, the consciousness of one who has the gnosis. These are the three.<br />
					And he footnotes the last: <i>Buddh. Psych. Eth. 86; VM. 491; Asl. 291; B.</i> 'The faculty of the <i><i>aññātāvin</i></i> the holder of things known), of him who, in the philosophy of the Four Truths, has completed what was to be done.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Anaññātaṃ-ñassāmīt-indriyaṃ:</i> PED: the faculty of him (who believes) "I shall know what is not known (yet)." The "not-known-knowing-controlling power."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Aññ'indriyaṃ:</i> PED has the faculty of perfect knowledge or of knowledge made perfect; <i>aññā</i> is a synonym for arahantship, and is the power to know whatever one wishes to know whenever one wishes to know it; a slightly different understanding of the idea of omniscience (knowing all things at all times).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Aññātāvindriyaṃ:</i> PED: known, recognized.<br />
					If these three are a "method," then they need to show progression as well as indicate technique. In my rendering I am suggesting they are forces that can be employed by the holder: the intent to know; the inspiration of the knowable itself; the reward of knowing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Interesting to note that PED has <i>Vī-maṃsā</i> derived from <i>vimansati</i> and that from <i>man</i> (mind) and defines it as consideration, examination, testing, investigation.
