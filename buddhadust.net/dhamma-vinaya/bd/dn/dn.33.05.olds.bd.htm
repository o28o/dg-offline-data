When you are free of those interferences then your mind is calm and rested and you are able to observe whatever is there. You are able to pay attention because your mind is not going after the past or the future, but just observing what is in the present moment. The ability to do that is facilitated by entering the <i>jhāna</i> because the <i>jhāna</i> is the state where the mind is free of the obscurants.</p>

					See the discussion of <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/dhamma_talk/fetters.htm">MN II, #64:</a> <i>Greater Discourse to Malunkyaputta,</i> PTS, Horner trans., pp102; Wisdom, Nanamoli/Bodhi trans., pp537. On the important distinction between there being these types of things existing in the world and their being fetters; it is only when obsession with or attachment to things in the ways described by the <i>saṃyojanas</i> develops that they become fetters. The difference is that holding that the thing itself is the problem makes the problem impossible to solve: one will never rid the world of own-self view, etc., and to say that one intends by that idea simply "ridding the self" of these things is to assume a self from which these things can be eliminated. It's like looking at the sky and saying that seeing the sky is a problem and then attempting to get rid of the sight of it by getting rid of the sky. Not only will one not succeed in getting rid of the sky in the world, the individuality will not get rid of seeing it (whether attached to it or not, when the eye of the individual looks at the world, it will see the sky). It is not the sky or the seeing of the sky that is the problem, it is the attachment to seeing the sky that is the problem.<br />
					This is the subtlety of Māra: that when the individuality comes in contact with some object and sense experience arises the habitual subjective tendancy is to identify with the reaction and to overlook the fact that the identification actually took place at the earlier stage. Then, when we strive after self-improvement, (if we fall into Malunkyaputta's error, which is likely) we focus on our reactions and not the source of the reaction: a situation that amounts to no more than simply pondering reaction (the image of Bugs Bunny furiously fighting with himself comes to mind). What the <i>saṃyojanas</i> describe is a variety of classes of sources of reaction to sense experience, and the task for the practitioner is not to get rid of these constructs, but by using them, to identify the areas where one is vulnerable to attachment. When one can slow down sufficiently (by "not-reacting", which is not the same thing as fighting one's reactions) to see that one is reacting to sense experience because of one or another of these ways to become attached, one is able to move the attention up passed that and focus on the original source: It is at that point that one has "got rid of the attachment to ..." or, in any case, is at least able to focus on the real problem with the predictable outcome that it will be solved soon enough.</p>

The compilers of the <i>Nikāyas</i> must therefore have considered the expression as pre-Buddhistic; but it has not yet been found in any pre-Buddhistic work.

There are also cases where this is accomplished almost immediately. Non-returners may be reborn in other realms than these, but only non-returners may be reborn in these realms. It is most likely that these realms form the basis of the belief in the Pure Abodes of the sect of Chinese Mahāyana Buddhists that call themselves the Pure Land Buddhists. This group, however, believes that these realms should be the destination of all beings ... sort of a staging area for the universal attainment of <i>Nibbāna</i> of all beings that is a main proposition of this school.

Today the word "jive" has come to mean something like talking bullshi, but in The Old Days the meaning was to throw certain words into one's speech suchas would act as a kind of mental parenthesis into which one could include some message that would pass unnoticed ... precursor of subliminal advertising. Today in RAP music this technique is being used so extensively as to render it ineffective. This is what is happening when they make a record stutter, or when they speak only half a word, or stutter a word and so forth: it produces a kind of break in the flow of pictures (or the "sense of a story") in the mind which is quickly "corrected" (made smooth) in memory, so what is said in the break is forgotten.

While it is doubtful that this sutta (I am talking about the whole <i>Saṅgīti Suttantaṃ</i>) was actually ever given like this, it is no doubt compiled from authentic suttas, and many of these were given in circumstances such as is described as the setting for this sutta: <i>i.e.,</i> for the in-group, after the 'many folk' had departed for the night. However, for the sake of clarity, here is how I would put the idea in "plain talk":</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In the first case we have the case of the beggar who is taught the <i>Dhamma</i> by The Master or by some Esteemed Guru in the Brahmā-life.
					In so far as what he is taught by the Master or by some esteemed Guru in the Brahmā-life (for example, he may only be taught ethics, not further <i>Dhamma</i>),<br />
					and to the extent that he is able to attain in experience what he has been taught (being told to act ethically, he acts ethically),<br />
					and to the extent that he has "got" understanding from that (acting ethically, he sees the benefit),<br />
					to this degree he will experience delight<br />
					from this delight comes enthusiasm,<br />
					enthusiastic in mind, the body becomes calm,<br />
					calm in body he experiences pleasure,<br />
					pleased in mind he is said to have attained serenity <i>(<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xsamaadhi">samadhi</a>.)</i><br />
					This is the first area experienced as freedom.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> <i><a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xsuta-1">Suta</a>ṃ.</i> here in the sense of "learned."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> <i>Pañca vimutati-paripācaniyā saññā.</i></p>
