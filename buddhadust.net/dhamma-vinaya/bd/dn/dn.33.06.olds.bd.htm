					Note on this group the differences between the way it is here and the way it is presented in <a href="dn.22.olds.bd.htm#p19">DN 22 §19</a> in The <i>Mahā Satipaṭṭhana Suttanta,</i> where it is: eye world <i>(loka),</i> material form world, sense consciousness <i>(viññāṇā),</i> contact <i>(phassa),</i> sense experience <i>(vedāna)</i>, perception <i>(sannā),</i> intention <i>(sancetana),</i> thirst <i>(taṇhā),</i> thinking about <i>(vitakka),</i> pondering <i>(vicara)</i> (that is, that the list includes <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicara.</i>)</p>

					<p class="lgqt">What is the importance of these groups?</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Focus.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This is where that thirst that leads to <i>dukkha</i> arises and is stopped. In other words, this is the <i>paṭicca samuppāda</i> between the six-fold sense sphere and <i>taṇhā,</i> or as it is in DN 22, between the six-fold sense sphere and <i>upadana.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">It is exactly at this level that I break ranks with the <i>Abhidhamma.</i> From here the <i>Abhidhamma</i> goes deeper into the analysis of the minute details of the evolution of becoming, such as to find itself, in my opinion, asserting certain things that are not acceptable <i>Dhamma</i> (such as "ultimate realities"). To my mind this is like a man standing at a chasm. The chasm is a thousand thousand feet deep (maybe bottomless), but only a couple of inches wide. But instead of stepping over the chasm the <i>Abhidhammist</i> goes down the near side with the idea of coming up the far side. Problem is he gets stuck because the chasm isn't wide enough at the bottom for him to travel the full depth. When the Buddha says "Well taught by me is the <i>Dhamma,</i>" (again, to my way of thinking) it is exactly with regard to cases such as this. What we are to do with the knowledge provided here is to understand that each of the senses has its own chain of dependencies, that each sense in its turn feeds the mind with the conscious impressions it receives so that the mind is able to piece together a picture <i>(saṅkāra),</i> form conclusions, and take action in its attempt to control the next set of sense experiences. When we understand the process in this general way the only further thing we need to understand the details for is to see where our weaknesses are: "I am more vulnerable to sights than tastes" or the reverse, or some such. This is where we need to concentrate our efforts to "put it away!" Analyzing it to the end of the world will not take us one step closer to letting it go, and consequently is a dangerous waste of time.</p>

					On <i>vicara,</i> see <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/give_ear/rethinking_vitakka.htm">pondering to a definition of <i>vicara.</i></a> "Stimulate" here is <i>upa.</i> The meaning of <i>upa</i> is clear enough, but whether you use investigation or pondering for <i>vicara,</i> we don't have a word I know of that does for up-making-<i>vicara.</i> <i>Somanassa</i> and <i>domanassa</i> are the strictly mental equivalents of <i>sukha</i> and <i>dukkha.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Walshe has "pleasurable investigations", but follows the text in the details: "... on seeing a sight-object with the eye ... one investigates a corresponding object productive of pleasure." In other words the experience of the object produces the sensation, it is not the investigation that produces the sensation. Rhys Davids has a similar construction.</p>

					<i>Nissaraṇīya</i> [grd. of <i>nissarati,</i> with relation to <i>nissaraṇa</i>] connected with deliverance, leading to salvation, able to be freed. The 3 n. <i>dhātuyo</i> (characteristics of deliverance) are <i>nekkhamma</i> (escape from cravings), <i>āruppa</i> (from existence with form), <i>nirodha</i> (from all existence).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Walshe has: "...Do not misrepresent the Blessed Lord, it is not right to slander him thus..." and Rhys Davids has "... Do not misrepresent the Exalted One! It is not well to calumniate the Exalted one." But this beggar, however far off the track he is here, is not, as we understand this in English, misrepresenting, slandering, or calumniating the Buddha. He is speaking about his own condition. I understand that this is being spoken by the Buddha, and is in essence saying "This man should be told that such a statement, made by one of my followers, insofar as he claims to represent my views, slanders me," but this does not come across clearly in translations. I have recast this to make sense today sticking as closely as I can to the original.</p>

					<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup></span> Walshe objects to Rhys Davids "memories" remembering the practice of recollecting the Buddha, <i>Dhamma</i> and <i>Saṅgha,</i> but this is not spelled out here and looks more like a reference to actually remembering the Buddha ... as the other categories here also appear to be having seen the Buddha, heard the Buddha teach, gained Arahantship, trained in this discipline, served the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Cha anussati-ṭhānāni.</i><br />
					This set, as contrasted with the previous, is the practice of bringing these ideas to mind in meditation, especially in situations where the mind has become distracted or upset or where the body has become uncomfortable. Try it, friends, it works, its not just devout sounding words. You have been sitting for one, two, three, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred minutes and your agitated/distracted/uncomfortable state is about one hair from getting you to give up, get up and get on with your ordinary downbound life. Focus on one of the many suttas you find here, or in your books, or that you have heard. Focus down close on it, so that you are tracing the words one after the other. Soon you will find yourself stilled, calmed, tranquilized, steady, unshakable. The Buddha says at this point to abandon this focus on the sutta or whatever once you have attained this goal. In practice it is more likely you will have abandoned it without thinking about it. But either way the other likelihood is that you will have considerably extended the duration of your sit down practice. Having extended the duration of your sit down practice, you have enjoyed a period of time without <i>Dukkha,</i> a period of time without pushing the wheel of <i>samsara,</i> you will have burnt off some old <i>kamma</i> and will be among those who have dwelt in the <a href="../../../dhammatalk/bd_dhammatalk/sitting_practice/on_1st_burning.htm">First Kenning.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt">To do this with the recollection of the Buddha, focus on something of the life of Gotama you have heard about and focus in on that until you can see it in your mind, and then focus in on the details, such as what came before, what comes after, what was said and to whom, and so forth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">To do this with <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#VeryPowerfulIndividuals">the Saṅgha,</a> focus in on one of the Arahants: Sāriputta, <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/moggallana.htm">Moggallāna,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/maha_kassapa.htm">Mahā Kassapo,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/ananda.htm">Ānanda,</a> <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anuruddha.htm">Anuruddha,</a> in this case, not as personalities, but as personifications (as it were) of stages of progress. Work out in your mind the stages that make up the <i>Saṅgha:</i> Streamwinner, Once-returner, non-returner, Arahant. Remember what you have heard about these stages and the individuals described as attaining these stages and work out in your mind what you, yourself, need to do to advance through these stages.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">To do this with <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualsila.htm">Ethical Culture,</a> go over the details of Ethical Culture as put forth in this system and compare these details with your own behavior.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">To do this with <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/gradualdana.htm">Generosity,</a> recollect some activity of generosity of yours and go over the details very carefully. Expand out the idea thinking about how you might do more of such activity in the future.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">To do this with the Gods, go over in mind <a href="../../../dhammatalk/the_pali_line/course/the10thquestion_1.htm#realms">the various gods;</a> put them in order in your mind, recollect what you have heard with regard to the way they live: food, clothing, shelter, <i>dukkha</i> and <i>sukha,</i> lifespan, what sort of deed was the proximate cause of rebirth in such a way. Here it is especially important to think of two things: "Is there within me any desire for rebirth in this manner?" (and if not, are you, in fact, thinking of some rebirth in an even lower state? such as rebirth again as human? Animal? Demon?) and "Does this life, however long, last forever?"</p>
