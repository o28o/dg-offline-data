"Wrong" has always been wrong in my view, for the same reasons that I have always considered "right" for <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/samma.htm">sammā</a> to be incorrect in that it is clearly not the case that these things described as <i>"miccha"</i> are being considered completely wrong any more than those things considered <i>"<a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xsammaa-2">sammā</a>"</i> are being considered completely right. Things that are <i>"miccha"</i> are wrong relative to the <i>"sammā"</i> the "consummate" position pointed out by the Buddha, which is the "best" but which is, itself, to be let go. With the clear relation of <i>"miccha"</i> to the English prefix "mis-" pointed out in the PED, I think I have found in "misguided" a much more satisfactory term. A good second might be "misconceived," considering the strong relationship of <i>miccha</i> to sexual intercourse. Probably the closest real term we have would be "matched" going to "mis-matched" but that would not work where no "match" is clear.<br />

Presumably it is because no such assemblies are recorded in the <i>Suttas,</i> nor mention of any hierarchy or government, as e.g., in Dial. I, 282; II, 242 f., 293 (21), etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Why are these important to know? Knowing about these will be sufficient for understanding any others. These are the assemblies that one is likely to encounter on this Way. It is important to be able to recognize the different assemblies to know the various forms of behavior that are expected (from those in the assembly, a beggars behavior is dictated by the <i>Dhamma</i>), to enter such assemblies without fear, with confidence, able to answer the questions that may come up concerning the <i>Dhamma</i> and one's own actions; things said and done long ago. This as a matter of showing the way.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Again note that this is not the first of the eights, or, (noting that there is no Eightfold <i>Path,</i> if there were an Eightfold Path, the second). So this sutta raises still another mystery: If, at the time of the composition of this sutta the Eightfold Path was not yet formalized into a <i>"Dhamma"</i> in and of itself then what is the relationship of this sutta in time to that of the <i>Mahā Satipaṭṭhana</i> and the other suttas that do include it? In other words: was this sutta, as it appears, composed after Sāriputta's death, but before the formalization (the making into a root doctrine) of the many suttas where we find the Eightfold Path? Could there have been several "tracks" of study of the system, some with and some without a formal Eightfold Path? Could this simply be a careless omission? If so, why wasn't it corrected by those who put the collection together? Remember that the time given for this sutta is at best days before the Buddha's own death. Curiouser and curiouser!<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><i>Ajjhattaṃ</i> and <i>bahiddhā:</i> Internal and external, inside and outside, subjective and objective, personal and belonging to others. The difficulty comes in when we mix up speaking conventionally and speaking precisely in terms of the <i>Dhamma.</i> Conventionally what we are talking about is that <i>"ajjhattam"</i> refers to whatsoever is considered "My self" (for some this may be virtually the whole world), and for <i>bahiddha</i> is whatever it may be that constitutes the world external to that which is considered "my self."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">There is one sutta where Sāriputta describes the external and internal, describing the internal in terms unmistakably relating to what we know of as the human body. Again and again what I am suggesting we must do is translate to the lowest common denominator. Those at a higher level will be able to extrapolate, those at the entry level must be given an opportunity to see the point in terms they can relate to: <i>Ajjhattam:</i> personal; <i>bahiddha:</i> external or objective.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">#1. Rhys Davids: "When anyone pictures to himself some material feature of his person and sees (corresponding) features in others, lovely or ugly, as small, transcending this (object) he is aware of doing so, (thinks) "I know, I see."<br />
					Walshe (For Walshe's translation of this see LDB (DN), sutta #16.3.25): "Perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms, limited and beautiful or ugly, and in mastering these, one is aware that one knows and sees them."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Rhys Davids has editorialized considerably in his translation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The problem here is in seeing these as different ways of having mastered the complete story, but what we are talking about here are generic perceptions, and these terms describe how one knows when one has "got that much" — perceiving this you have mastered this type of perceiving. This first stage puts aside insight into the personal, but has mastered the external by seeing it as limited whatsoever its degree of attractiveness. (The presence or absence of the judgment "beautiful or ugly" is the clue; present it indicates that one is not yet perceiving directly; but is perceiving through the filter of sensation and consciousness.) What remains is to make the perception conscious by the thought: "I know, I see." Without this thought, doubt remains and one has not mastered this far even though one may have precisely the same perception as one who has mastered. Much of this system is of the same nature; that is, that the difference between one who knows and one who does not know is only in the knowing that one knows. ... but don't think you can fake it or bluff your way around one who knows. Not knowing, one does not know where what one does know stops and where what one does not know starts (one value of this set), and one is liable to be tripped up in a debate on the matter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> What is the point of the "... whether beautiful or ugly"? (Why this set of judgments over any other?) Again because they are generic, rock bottom fundamental, and because the tendency in these situations is to see the one or the other as representing mastery; being "the right way of perceiving," (the tendency as a Buddhist, for example might be that it is only when perceiving everything external as ugly, that one had mastered it; the tendency of most other systems would be to think of only the beautiful perception as the one representing mastery) whereas that aspect of what one is perceiving is not significant.</p>
