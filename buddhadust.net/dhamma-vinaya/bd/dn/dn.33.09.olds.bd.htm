					<p class="lgqt">Walshe: What good would it do (to harbor malice)?"<br />
					Rhys Davids: "But what gain would there be to either of us if I quarreled about it" (citing the commentators).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The over-all idea is how do we control our own aggressive impulses. Both Walshe and Rhys Davids, interpreting from their understanding of the system, hear "We control our aggression by seeing its futility," (essentially "suppression") but need to add words not found in the <i>Pāḷi</i> to make this work.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">On the other hand reading this as "looking for the good to be gained from the situation" (essentially redirection) works both for the idea of controlling aggression and fits the <i>Pāḷi</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Then this can also be heard as "But what good would that do <i>him.</i>" Elsewhere we understand that anger is the consequence of not having paid sufficient attention when in contact with an unpleasant sense experience, it is a reaction to an unpleasant sense experience, and that the "avoidance" of this situation is to be had by cultivation of friendly vibrations. In any case, the way I have worded it, it can be heard in the flexible way I believe was intended by the original.</p>

					Rhys Davids translates: "Nine untimely unseasonable, intervals for life in a religious order."<br />
					Walshe has: "Nine unfortunate, inopportune times for leading the holy life."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The problem is that this construction looks like it is saying that living the Brahmā-life during such "intervals" or " times" is unlucky; but the meaning must be that it is not possible to lead the Brahmā-life if reborn in these situations; one cannot live the Brahmā Life reborn in Hell; one has been unlucky in one's birth in that one is reborn when a Buddha has come to be, but is in some way unable to hear/follow his teachings, or one has been reborn at a time when no Buddha is present in the world and his <i>Dhamma</i> is not being taught at that time. These are not situations like our current time, when, although the Buddha is not visibly present, he is present in the form of the <i>Dhamma.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Pari-nibbāniko:</i> aka "Final <i>Nibbāna</i>," but here it appealed to me more to give the more literal meaning of <i>Nibbāna</i> as I think it has more meaning here that way.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Since it is a very long time between the appearances of Buddhas, most likely this refers only to the gods at the level of the <i>Abhassara</i> Realm and above. See also <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/appendixes.htm#fiftyyearsofhumanlife">Lifespan</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> PED: <i>Yiṭṭha</i> having sacrificed D I.138 ... sacrificed ... sacrifice D I.55 ... <i>du-y-yiṭṭha</i> not properly sacrificed, a sacrifice not according to rites. In specific Buddhistic sense "given, offered as alms, spent as liberal gift" ... <i>su-yiṭṭha</i> well given or spent A II.44.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Nava anupubba-vihārā.</i><br />
					<i>Anupubba-vihāra:</i> (after-previous livings) Walshe has "successive abidings;" Rhys Davids has "successional states;" PED states: "a state of gradually ascending stages, by means of which the highest aim of meditation and trance is attained, viz. complete cessation of all sense-consciousness." But this is neither correct on the face of it, nor correct in spirit. The so called "trance of succession" is not the goal, is not <i>Nibbāna,</i> is itself own-made, and is to be let go. Sāriputta describes this state as the experience of being conscious of one state passing away and another arising. It is simply that this is the highest wordly refinement of consciousness that one in this system is to strive after. At this state of consciousness one should have been able to see the constructed nature of all the previous states as well as this state, and should see the benefit of letting go of all own-made (<i>sankaramed</i>) states, but, again, it is not, itself, the state of having completely let go or of having attained <i>Nibbāna.</i><br />
