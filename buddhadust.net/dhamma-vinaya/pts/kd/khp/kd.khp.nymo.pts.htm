					<h4 class="ctr">Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>This — the shortest of all the books in the Pāḷi Tipiṭaka — might be regarded as a sort of handbook, a practical <i>vade mecum</i> whose contents represent the central doctrines of the Buddha's teaching. It comes first among the fourteen books that make up the Fifth <i>Nikāya,</i> or Collection of Minor Books, in the <i>Sutta Piṭaka</i> of the Pāḷi Tipiṭaka. Its traditional history is given in the Commentary.</p>
					
					<p>It has already been translated once into English as it stands, namely, in <i>Minor Anthologies,</i> Vol. I, by Mrs. C.A.F. Bhys Davids [<i>Sacred Books of the Buddhists,</i> London, 1931). But its. contents almost all appear also in other canonical books, and so several other versions of them will be found in the respective translations. The following list shows in what books:</p>

					<p>In spite of this fact, a new translation was decided on. This was not undertaken either out of any expectation to outdo what others have already done or 'to carp at others and give blame' (<i>KhpA.</i> Ch. i, § 2) — great and never-ending fun as that is, of course —; it was simply dictated by the need for coherence in the renderings of technical terms, which became so desirable as to claim necessity when the Commentary was being translated and coordinated. One advantage of this was that it saved the translator the invidious task of picking and choosing between the existing excellent translations.</p>

					<p><a id="pgvi"><span class="f2 g"><b>[vi]</b></span></a> As to the alternatives of prose or verse, the latter was decided on in spite of the risks. Rhymes seemed out of place here, and the choice of metre has been arbitrary with no attempt to reflect Pāḷi rhythms, which the supple analytical English idiom does not support. The foremost aim throughout has been accuracy with literalness (recalling, however, that the more literal the rendering of an <i>idiomatic phrase</i> is the less accurate it will be); other aims, such as style and language shades have been subordinated. Also a brevity has been sought that does not draw up into the rendering of the verses the Commentary's explanations of them. In fact, when verses are of such a nature as to allow of more than one interpretation in the Pāḷi (for instance, such elliptic lines as those at <a href="#VIII">No. VIII, v. 8</a> and <a href="#IX">No. IX, v. 1</a>), the attempt has deliberately been made to reproduce that effect, and, so far as has been possible, to make the English as difficult as the original though not more so, and difficult in the same or a parallel way, leaving the Commentary to do its work of expansion and explanation (with the addition of some notes).</p>
					
					<p>Other matters of a general nature affecting translation are dealt with in the Introduction to the Commentary.</p>
					
					<p>The following acknowledgements are due. First to all those <i>Theras of Ceylon</i> and <i>Burma</i> with whom the translator has had the opportunity to discuss the <i>Dhamma</i> and the Pāḷi language, without whose readily given help this translation of the Commentary would not have taken shape. Again, in general, to other translators from Pāḷi, because their work is a standing help, stimulation and encouragement. And the translator gladly expresses his gratitude in particular to the Burmese authorities and to the Assistant Librarian at Ceylon University for the information about the lost <i>Tīkā</i> (see Introduction to Commentary, p. v); to the Pāḷi Text Society for undertaking to publish this translation, and to Miss I.B. Horner for most kindly consenting to read through the MS and for many valuable suggestions and help with the proofs.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>It was with deep grief that we heard of the sudden death of the Ven. Ñāṇamoli on March 8th, 1960. He had corrected the proofs but had not seen the revises of this book. I have therefore been responsible for them. He was a scholar of rare and valuable qualities and his death has dealt a severe blow to Pāḷi studies.</p>

							So by this very truth may there be safety.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">8. As a locking-post deep-planted in the earth<br />
					Would stand unshaken by the four winds' blast,<br />
					So too, indeed, is the True Man, I say,<br />
					That sees the Noble Truths by undergoing:</p>
							<p class="f4 in2">This jewel rare is in the Community;<br />
							So by this very truth may there be safety.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">9. Such as clearly evince the Noble Truths<br />
					Well taught by Him Profound in Understanding,<br />
					Although they may be mightily neglectful,<br />
					Still they can never take an eighth existence:</p>
							<p class="f4 in2">This jewel rare is in the Community;<br />
							So may there by this very truth be safety.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">10. Along, too, with his excellence in seeing<br />
					He comes to have abandoned three ideas:<br />
					View of embodiment, uncertainty,<br />
					[Misapprehending] virtue and duty, all;<br />
					Immune from the four states of deprivation,<br />
					He cannot do the major six wrongdoings:</p>
							<p class="f4 in2">This jewel rare is in the Community;<br />
							So may there by this very truth be safety.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">11. <a id="pg6"><span class="f2 g"><b>[6]</b></span></a> Though he can still perform an evil action<br />
					By body even, or by speech or mind,<br />
					Yet he cannot conceal it, and this fact<br />
					Proclaims him that has seen the State [of Peace]:</p>
							<p class="f4 in2">This jewel rare is in the Community;<br />
							So may there by this very truth be safety.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">12. As a tall forest tree with blossom crowned<br />
					In the warm summer month, the early heat,<br />
					Such the glorious Ideal he displayed,<br />
					Extinction-leading, for the weal supreme:</p>
							<p class="f4 in2">This jewel rare is in the Enlightened One;<br />
							So may there by this very truth be safety.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">13. Glorious knower, giver, bringer of glory,<br />
					Peerless, he taught the glorious True Ideal:</p>
							<p class="f4 in2">This jewel rare is in the Enlightened One;<br />
							So may there by this very truth be safety.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">14. Consumed the old, the new no more gives being,<br />
					From cognizance lust faded for new being,<br />
					The germ consumed, they have no more zeal for growth,<br />
					And steadfast, they go out, as did this lamp:</p>
							<p class="f4 in2">This jewel rare is in the Community;<br />
							So may there by this very truth be safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. Without the walls they stand and wait,<br />
					And at the junctions and road-forks;<br />
					Returning to their erstwhile homes,<br />
					They wait beside the jambs of gates.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">2. But when a rich feast is set out<br />
					With food and drink of every kind,<br />
					The fact that no man does recall<br />
					These creatures stems from their past acts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">3. So they who are compassionate<br />
					At heart do give for relatives<br />
					Such drink and food as may be pure<br />
					And good and fitting at these times:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">4. 'Then let this be for relatives;<br />
					'May relatives have happiness.'<br />
					These ghosts of the departed kin<br />
					Foregathered and assembled there</p>
					
					<p class="f4">5. Will eagerly their blessing give<br />
					For [plentiful] rich food and drink:<br />
					'So may our relatives live long,<br />
					'Owing to whom we have this gain;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">6. 'For honour to us has been done,<br />
					'No giver ever lacked the fruit.'<br />
					Now there is never ploughing there,<br />
					Nor any cattle-herding found,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">7. Nor merchandizing just the same,<br />
					Nor bartering for coin of gold:<br />
					The ghosts of the departed kin<br />
					Live there on giving given here;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">8. As water showered on the hill<br />
					Flows down to reach the hollow vale,<br />
					So giving given here can serve<br />
					The ghosts of the departed kin.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">9. As river-beds when full can bear<br />
					The water down to fill the sea,<br />
					So giving given here can serve<br />
					The ghosts of the departed kin.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">10. 'He gave to me, he worked for me,<br />
					'He was my kin, friend, intimate'.<br />
					<a id="pg8"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span></a> Give gifts, then, for departed ones,<br />
					Recalling what they used to do.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">11. No weeping, nor yet sorrowing,<br />
					Nor any kind of mourning, aids<br />
					Departed Ones, whose kin remain<br />
					[Unhelpful to them acting] thus.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">12. But when this offering is given<br />
					Well placed in the Community<br />
					For them, then it can serve them long<br />
					In future and at once as well.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">13. The True Idea for relatives has thus been shown,<br />
					And how high honour to departed ones is done,<br />
					And how the bhikkhus can be given strength as well,<br />
					And how great merit can be stored away by you.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. A man a treasure store lays by<br />
					Deep in a water-level pit;<br />
					He thinks 'If need arise for aid,<br />
					It will be there to aid me then,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">2. For my discharge from kings, were I<br />
					Denounced, or from a brigand, else<br />
					If held to ransom, or of debts,<br />
					In famines, or in accidents':<br />
					With suchlike aims, what in the world<br />
					Is called a store will be laid by.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">3. Though be it ne'er so well laid by<br />
					Deep in a water-level pit,<br />
					Not all of it will yet suffice<br />
					To serve him all the time; and then</p>
					
					<p class="f4">4. The store gets shifted from its place,<br />
					Or he perhaps forgets the marks,<br />
					Or Nāga-Serpents hale it off,<br />
					Or spirits fritter it away,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">5. Or else the heirs he cannot bear<br />
					Abstract it while he does not see;<br />
					And when his merit is consumed,<br />
					The whole will vanish utterly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">6. But when a woman or a man<br />
					<a id="pg9"><span class="f2 g"><b>[9]</b></span></a> Shall have with gifts or virtuousness<br />
					Or with refraining or constraint<br />
					A store of merit well laid by</p>
					
					<p class="f4">7. In shrines or the Community,<br />
					Or in a person or in guests<br />
					Or in a mother or a father,<br />
					Even in an elder brother,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">8. This treasure store is well laid by,<br />
					A follower unlosable:<br />

					Have to be gone [to] he goes with this.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">9. No others have a share in it,<br />
					And robbers cannot steal this store;<br />
					So let the steadfast merit make,<br />
					The store that is their follower.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">10. This is a store can satisfy<br />
					Every desire of god or man;<br />
					No matter what they aspire to have:<br />
					All that is got by merit's grace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">11. Beauty of looks, beauty of voice,<br />
					Beauty of figure, beauty of form,<br />
					And lordliness and retinue:<br />
					All that is got by merit's grace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">12. A local kingship, empire, too,<br />
					Bliss of Wheel-turning Monarchy,<br />
					And godly rule in paradise:<br />
					All that is got by merit's grace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">13. And every human excellence,<br />
					Any delight in a godly world,<br />
					Even extinction's excellence:<br />
					All that is got by merit's grace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">14. A man has excellence in friends;<br />
					Devoting reason right, he wins<br />
					True knowledge and deliverance:<br />
					All that is got by merit's grace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">15. Discriminations, liberations,<br />
					Perfection of disciples, too,<br />
					And both kinds of enlightenment:<br />
