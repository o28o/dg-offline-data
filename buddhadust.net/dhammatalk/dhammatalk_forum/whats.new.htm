					<p class="f4">"Borges makes it unmistakably clear that every translation is a "version" — not <i>the</i> translation of Homer (or any other author) but <i>a</i> translation, one in a never-ending series, at least an infinite possible series. The very idea of the (definitive) translation is misguided, Borges tells us: there are only drafts, approximations — versions, as he insists on calling them. He chides us: "The concept of 'definitive text' is appealed to only by religion, or by weariness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Borges has tried in is essays to teach us, however, that we should not translate "against" our predecessors; a new translation is always justified by the new voice given the old work, by the new life in a new land that the translation confers on it, by the "shock of the new" that both old and new readers will experience from this inevitably new (or renewed) work."</p>
					
					<p class="f2">From "A Note on the Translations," by Andrew Hurley, Professor of English at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan, in <b><i>Jorge Luis Borges, Collected Fictions</i></b>. Most of this could be profitably noted by today's translator's of the Buddha's word, but I would except one idea: While not <i>"translating against"</i> our fellow translators here, I think it is not unfair to point out wrong translation and, where the translator has made the claim that his is <i>the</i> definitive translation of the Buddha's word, where he has given us his own ideas "against" the <i>Pāḷi.</i> There is a point to the Buddha's work that makes it a different proposition than translating fiction. It is instruction as to how to save ourselves from <i>kamma,</i> rebirth, and pain. Wrong translation misleads and is, I believe, righteously pointed out. <i>Dukkha</i> can be translated as suffering, distress, unsatisfactoryness, angst, stress, pain, shit without being "wrong," but it cannot be translated "watermelon" and escape being identified as incorrectly translated.</p>

					<p class="f4">The idea that the Pāḷi Text Society translations, (Only completed in 1959) are not an acceptable source of information about the teachings of the Buddha because they are "archaic" is crazy.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I just did a Google search on which version of the Bible was the most popular: it is the King James Version. This version was first published in 1601. It is today the most translated version (55% with the next closest being 15%). It is the most read version. There is no consensus as to which version is the most accurate translation of the original Hebrew and Greek.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The statement that the PTS translations are no good because they use archaic language is just blind talk motivated by self-interest.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The main advantage is that this is the only version that is overtly linguistic, meaning that the errors in it (and there are quite a few) are in the understanding of the language, not in the understanding of what the Buddha taught. The mistakes therefore are highly visible and easy to avoid where the bias shown in all the other translations we have today are in comprehension of the Buddha's system and slip by mostly unnoticed and accepted as a faithful understanding of what is being taught.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For more on this, see <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/give_ear/ge_015.importance_pts.htm">On the Importance of the Pāḷi Text Society Translations</a> in the <a href="../../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/df_toc.htm">Forum.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Ease of reading and undersanding is not the best criteria for judging a translation of the Buddha's teaching. If the goal is incorrectly understood, ease of reading and understanding, mistaken for the explanation of what the Buddha taught is exactly wrong.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A better criteria is "Does this translation lead to freedom, dispassion, letting go, ending?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable Mew Fung Chen, (at the time (c 1966 and, as far as I know to the present) Master of the China Buddhist Association in New York. Chan Buddhism.) early in his career and when just beginning to learn English, translated <i>'Dhamma'</i> as 'Mother/Father'. This may be the most accurate definition — 'Da' and 'Ma' — in spirit — the guides, teachers — that which brings us up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am not a Chan Buddhist nor am I a follower of Venerable Mew Fung, but I have never been troubled by understanding <i>'Dhamma'</i> in this way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This also gives us an example of another way of understanding etymology.</p>

					<p class="f4">A very few main entry terms have had their citations linked to the texts found on this site. This will not likely be a feature that will soon be implemented (I estimate that for one person to link every citation to its source document could take as much as 100 to 200 years!) Some important and often troublesome terms may have their citations to the four Nikāyas linked.

					creating a book-style subject index (a full index is not needed as the dictionary itself acts as an index to the meanings of Pāḷi words.

					<h4 class="ctr">Foreshadowing, Tracks and After-Images</h4>					
					
					<p class="f4">There is lots of talk about <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xnimitta">Nimittas:</a> — What they are, what they mean.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The <i>Vissudhimagga</i> speaks of the <i>nimitta</i> as the reflex image of a <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xkasi_na-2">kasina.</a> Something like the after-image in green when one stares at red for a time (but without the inversion); a mental image of a physical thing one has used to attain kenning <i>(<a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xjhaana-1">jhāna</a>),</i> seeing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The forest dwelling <i>bhikkhus</i> that follow the teachings of <a href="../../backmatter/indexes/idx_downloads.htm#mun">Ācariya Mun</a> understand it as a vision that foretells the future or the meaning of some thing in the present.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Others may think of the <i>nimitta</i> as simply a sign that they have reached a certain level in meditation practice. They are able to 'see' a light.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What it is in terms of the phenomena is the partially formed or wholly formed image of a thing or a scene or scenario as it enters, remains and exits the mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A thing does not at first manifest itself wholly formed, it is compiled from multiple images. Becoming aware of those images before a thing has actually materialized one sees a foreshadowing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This can be of a thing one is about to become aware of, or it may be an event in the near or even far future or near or far in the past. And it can be manipulated at certain points by other projections.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such a thing can be seen in its various stages of development even after it has become manifested in the world or after it has passed from the world. It is another way of understanding memory <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xsati">(sati)</a> "Once-Thus".</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When it is an image of a thing having had "self" projected into it, (something <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xsa-nkhaara">saṅkāra</a>med); once it has become a "real" thing, it is a "track". The arahant, having no wishes or thoughts of projecting self into anything, leaves no tracks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All <i>nimitta</i> are projections made by some being or another; a wish, a thought projecting self into a situation, sometimes as an actor, sometimes as an observer; sometimes as a recognizable object, sometimes as a fantastical one, sometimes with form, sometimes without form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So a person who has fully developed, say, the space device, can project space into an incompletely-formed foreshadowing of a wall such that he can pass through that wall. Observers without such vision will only see (if they see anything unusual at all) the passing through the wall. They will not see how it was done. The ordinary man wishing to develop such skill will do nothing more than injure his body bounding off the "solid" wall he is certain is there.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Devices <i>(kasinas)</i> are not necessary, and seem to me to be limiting, rather more than helpful. Whatever one wishes to do or see can be visualized mentally. But maybe it is useful for some. For me, all I got was a black eye from staring fixedly at the water device.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seeing a foreshadowing of a track, or a track, or a vision of a track from the past one will know what the thoughts of the being making such a track were.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Intentional creation of a projected image, (a track) is otherwise called <i><a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xiddhi">'iddhi'</a></i> and for the most part is deprecated by the Buddha as a trick, but certain aspects of it are frequently practiced (for example, visiting other realms in the body or in an astral body, or seeing past lives, or seeing the outcome of an action.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the Editor's Preface: <i>"This book is a posthumous publication bought to fruition by a group of the author's devoted pupils. For some, this book will be a treasury of previously unpublished material, shedding novel light on the profound and exacting discourses of the Buddha. It will be intensely provocative for others, querying long-held sentiments and opposing normative modes of Buddhist ideology and application. For others still, the notions expounded in the book will seem heretical to Buddhist tradition, resulting in their dismissal as the views of a recalcitrant monk.<br />
					Wherever the reader's reaction may fall on this spectrum, we trust that investing some time with an open mind could be well worth the labor, particularly for those drawn to the early, pre-sectarian Buddhist theories, practices, and texts."</i></p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have not yet read this book so have no comment to make about it, but as for Venerable Punnjai, I would say that the west, particularly the US ows its current interest in meditation and mindfulnes almost entirely to him. I was there. I was there from the beginning. I saw it happening. I was partly responsible for his first coming to this country. I was one of the first, maybe the first, of his followers. I had many disagrements with him about his use of Pāḷi, very little disagreement with his practice. His contribution to the advancement of Buddhism should not be forgotten.</p>

'The eye is the thing grasped, the lust is the grasping." Bhk. Bodhi: 'The eye is a thing that can be clung to, the desire and lust for it is the clinging there.' But I don't think the idea is 'clinging' either in regard to the <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xkhandha"><i>khandhas</i></a> or in its place in the <a href="../../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm#xpa_ticca-samuppaada"><i>Paṭicca Samuppāda.</i></a> This word must stand for 'going after or supporting or fueling getting' or 'going towards, supporting, fueling making' not trying to keep, hang on to, what has already been got.<br />

A single idea, not two or three or a half dozen separate ideas.<br />
					Interesting that Bhikkhu Thanissaro should be rendering the term as a compound such as I describe here. I think, though, that in stead of his "desire-passion" I would have used "passionate-desire."<br />

					The Buddha teaches that the things that give rise to what yokes one to rebirth are forms, sense-experiences, perceptions, own-making, and sense-consciousness, whereas the yokes themselves are the wants and desires connected to these things.<br />
					The point is to not think that it is the world that needs to change, but to focus on what it is within one's self that needs to change. It is by teaching the opposite of this lesion that the activist Buddhists lead people astray.</p>
