<td class="right"><p>Then the 80,000 villagers, (thinking), “How amazing! How astounding!—in that even the disciple could be so mighty and powerful. Wow! What about the teacher?” focused on the Blessed One, not as much on Ven. Sāgata.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td class="full" colspan="2"><p class="note">1. As the word <em>itthiyutta</em> is a compound, the case ending of the noun <em>itthi</em> is omitted. The Commentary interprets it as taking the accusative case: ‘Woman-yoked’ means ‘yoked to a woman’, which only makes sense if ‘woman’ is an unusual way of referring to a female animal. Then <em>antara</em> “inside”, has to refer to the driver. But <em>itthi</em> could instead take the instrumental case: ‘yoked by a woman’. And in the passage from MN 21 below, the driver is referred to as a ‘yoking master’ (yoggācariya). ‘Yogga’ and ‘yutta’ are both derived from the root ‘yuj’, a cognate of the Engish word ‘yoke’. This points to another interpretation: The man or woman who yoked the vehicle and the driver are one and the same, and the person inside the vehicle is a passenger.</p>
<p class="note">Although <em>itthi</em> and <em>purisa</em> can refer to feminine and masculine qualities in general (as in grammatical categories), it seems odd to use the same word for “cow” and “woman”, as with “bull” and “man”. I know of no other passage in the Canon that uses the words that way. Also, it’s hard to imagine why the sex of the animal would be more important than that of the driver, unless the rule was meant to prohibit Brahmanical practices, like riding in a cart yoked to white mares, as the brahman Jāṇussoṇin does in the <a title="Nr" href="https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN45_4.html">Brāhmaṇa Sutta (SN 45:4)</a>. On the other hand, a rule prohibiting riding in a vehicle with a woman driving fits with the rule against traveling by arrangement with a woman.
