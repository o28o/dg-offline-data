<h2 id="intro">Translator’s Introduction</h2>

<p>The Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha contains 311 rules. Of these, 181 are shared with the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha: four Pārājikas, seven Saṅghādisesas, 18 Nissaggiya Pācittiyas (NP), 70 Pācittiyas, all 75 Sekhiyas, and all seven Adhikaraṇa-samatha rules. In addition, the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha contains 13 Pācittiya rules that are identical to rules for bhikkhus that are contained in the Khandhakas; one Pārājika rule similar to a Bhikkhus’ Saṅghādisesa rule; one Pārājika rule similar to a Bhikkhus’ Pācittiya rule; two Saṅghādisesa rules similar to Bhikkhus’ Khandhaka rules; two NP rules similar to Bhikkhus’ NP rules; three Pācittiyas similar to a Bhikkhus’ Saṅghādisesa; seven Pācittiyas similar to Bhikkhus’ Pācittiyas; and eight Pācittiyas similar to rules for bhikkhus that are contained in the Khandhakas. Also, the eight Pāṭidesanīya rules for the bhikkhunīs are elaborations of a single Bhikkhus’ Pācittiya rule.</p>

<p>Thus the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha contains 85 rules for which there are no direct correspondences in the rules for the bhikkhus. Some writers have interpreted these added rules as sign of an attempt to oppress the bhikkhunīs unfairly, but it should be noted that: </p>

<ol>
<li>more than one third of these extra rules were formulated to protect bhikkhunīs from being the direct recipients of the abusive or careless behavior of other bhikkhunīs;</li>

<li>two of the extra rules (Pācittiyas <a href="#pc-6">6</a> and <a href="#pc-44">44</a>) prevent bhikkhunīs from putting themselves in a position of servitude to bhikkhus or lay people;</li>

<li>according to the rules’ origin stories, all but three of the extra rules (Pācittiyas <a href="#pc-59">59</a>, <a href="#pc-94">94</a>, and <a href="#pc-95">95</a>) were formulated only after bhikkhunīs complained to the bhikkhus about an errant bhikkhunī’s behavior.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tellingly, these last three exceptions were formulated after complaints initiated by the bhikkhus, and they touch directly on the formal subordination of the Bhikkhunī Community to the Bhikkhu Community. However, they are counterbalanced by two rules exclusive to the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha — <a href="/vinaya/bhikkhu-pati.html#np-4">NP 4</a> &amp; <a href="/vinaya/bhikkhu-pati.html#np-17">17</a> — that were formulated at the request of bhikkhunīs to prevent bhikkhus from abusing their position in the hierarchy in a way that would interfere with the bhikkhunīs’ practice of the Dhamma. For a more detailed discussion of the checks and balances in the relationships between the two Communities, see <a href="/vinaya/bmc/Section0065.html"><em>The Buddhist Monastic Code, Volume II, Chapter 23</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the following translation, I have marked the correspondences between the bhikkhus’ and bhikkhunīs’ rules in brackets. Where the brackets follow the number of the bhikkhunī rule and simply contain a number, the corresponding bhikkhus’ rule is in the same section in the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha as in the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha. Thus, under the Saṅghādisesa rules, 7 [5] means that the Bhikkhunīs’ Saṅghādisesa 7 is identical with the Bhikkhus’ Saṅghādisesa 5. If the brackets follow the rule and simply contain a reference to a rule in the Mahavagga (Mv) or Cullavagga (Cv), the corresponding bhikkhus’ rule is contained in the Khandhakas. If the brackets follow the rule and include the word “see” followed by a number, the corresponding bhikkhus’ rule is similar rather than identical. Correspondences in the Sekhiya and Adhikaraṇa-samatha sections are not marked, as these two sections are completely identical in the two Pāṭimokkhas.</p>

<p>Rules marked with an asterisk (*) are identical with — or directly related to — vows included in the Eight Garudhammas, or Rules of Respect. On this topic, see <a href="/vinaya/bmc/Section0065.html"><em>The Buddhist Monastic Code, Volume II, Chapter 23</em></a>. Some writers have argued that, because the rules in question are all pācittiya rules, and because the Rules of Respect impose a more stringent penalty than a simple confession for overstepping the vows, we must assume that the vows and their more stringent punishment were added later to the canon, in an attempt to oppress the bhikkhunīs. However, a standard principle throughout the Vinaya — formulated in Adhikaraṇa-samatha 4 in both Pāṭimokkhas — is that an offender cannot be penalized until he/she has confessed to an offense. In light of this principle, the confession required by the pācittiya rules would be a first, necessary step before imposing the half-month penance stipulated in the fifth vow.</p>

<p>The translation here is based on the complete Pāli Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha in Mohan Wijayaratna, <em>Buddhist Nuns: The Birth and Development of a Women’s Monastic Order</em> (BN), although there were many spots where I had to rely on the Thai edition of the Pāli Canon to correct mistakes in BN. I have also consulted I.B. Horner’s partial English translation of the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha rules in <em>The Book of Discipline,</em> volume three (BD); the partial Thai translation included in Mahamakut’s complete translation of the Pāli Canon; the complete English translation in BN; and the complete translation in <em>The Pāṭimokkha,</em> edited by William Pruitt and translated by K. R. Norman (N). Where my translation differs from BD, I have marked it with a (§); where it differs from BN, a (¶); where it differs from N, a (•). </p>

<p>Parenthetical insertions in the rules, if otherwise unmarked, are based on the canonical word-commentary from the Bhikkhunī Vibhanga, the part of the Vinaya Pitaka that contains the Bhikkhunī Pāṭimokkha together with its explanatory material. If marked with the abbreviation “Comm:”, parenthetical insertions in the rules are drawn from the Commentary, Buddhaghosa’s Samantapasadika. Technical issues are explained in the endnotes.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="pr">Pārājika</h2>

<p id="pr-1"><strong>1 [<a href="/vinaya/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr-1">1</a>].</strong> Should any bhikkhunī willingly engage in sexual intercourse, even with a male animal, she is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p id="pr-2"><strong>2 [<a href="/vinaya/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr-2">2</a>].</strong> Should any bhikkhunī, in what is reckoned a theft, take what is not given from an inhabited area or from the wilderness — just as when, in the taking of what is not given, kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish her, saying, “You are a robber, you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a thief” — a bhikkhunī in the same way taking what is not given is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p id="pr-3"><strong>3 [<a href="/vinaya/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr-3">3</a>].</strong> Should any bhikkhunī intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die, saying, “My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life,” or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p id="pr-4"><strong>4 [<a href="/vinaya/bhikkhu-pati.html#pr-4">4</a>].</strong> Should any bhikkhunī, without direct knowledge, boast of a superior human state, a truly noble knowledge and vision as present in herself, saying, “Thus do I know; thus do I see,” such that regardless of whether or not she is cross-examined on a later occasion, she — being remorseful and desirous of purification — might say, “Ladies, not knowing, I said I know; not seeing, I said I see — vainly, falsely, idly,” unless it was from over-estimation, she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.</p>

<p><a id="pr-5">5</a>. Should any bhikkhunī, lusting, consent to a lusting man’s rubbing, rubbing up against, taking hold of, touching, or fondling (her) below the collar-bone and above the circle of the knees, she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation for being “one above the circle of the knees.” [See <a href="/vinaya/bhikkhu-pati.html#sg-2">Bhikkhus’ Saṅghādisesa 2</a>]</p>

<p><a id="pr-6">6</a>. Should any bhikkhunī, knowing that (another) bhikkhunī has fallen into an act (entailing) defeat, neither accuse her herself nor inform the group, and then — whether she (the other bhikkhunī) is still alive or has died, has been expelled or gone over to another sect — she (this bhikkhunī) should say, “Even before, ladies, I knew of this bhikkhunī that ‘This sister is of such-and-such a sort,’ and I didn’t accuse her myself nor did I inform the group,” then she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation for being “one who concealed a fault.” [See <a href="/vinaya/bhikkhu-pati.html#pc-64">Bhikkhus’ Pācittiya 64</a>]</p>

<p><a id="pr-7">7</a>. Should any bhikkhunī follow a bhikkhu who has been suspended by a united Community (of bhikkhus) in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher’s instructions, and who is disrespectful, has not made amends, has broken off his friendship (with the bhikkhus), the bhikkhunīs are to admonish her thus: “Lady, that bhikkhu has been suspended by a united Community in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher’s instructions. He is disrespectful, he has not made amends, he has broken off his friendship. Do not follow him, lady.”</p>

<p>And should that bhikkhunī, thus admonished by the bhikkhunīs, persist as before, the bhikkhunīs are to rebuke her up to three times for the sake of relinquishing that. If while being rebuked up to three times she relinquishes that, that is good. If she does not relinquish that, then she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation for being “a follower of a suspended (bhikkhuī).” (§¶•) <span class="fn"><a href="#fn-1" id="fnt-1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="pr-8">8</a>. Should any bhikkhunī, lusting, consent to a lusting man’s taking hold of her hand or touching the edge of her outer robe, or should she stand with him or converse with him or go to a rendezvous with him, or should she consent to his approaching her, or should she enter a hidden place with him, or should she dispose her body to him — (any of these) for the purpose of that unrighteous act (Comm: physical contact) — then she also is defeated and no longer in affiliation for “(any of) eight grounds.” (§)</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="sg">Saṅghādisesa</h2>

<p id="sg-1"><strong>1.</strong> Should any bhikkhunī start litigation against a householder, a householder’s son, a slave, or a worker, or even against a wandering contemplative: this bhikkhunī, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community. (•)</p>

<p id="sg-2"><strong>2.</strong> Should any bhikkhunī knowingly give Acceptance <em>(upasampada)</em> to a woman thief sentenced to death, without having obtained permission from the king or the Community or the (governing) council or the (governing) committee or the (governing) guild — unless the woman is allowable (i.e., already ordained in another sect or with other bhikkhunīs) — this bhikkhunī, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community. [See Mv.I.43.1]</p>

<p id="sg-3"><strong>3.</strong> Should any bhikkhunī go among villages alone or go to the other shore of a river alone or stay away for a night alone or fall behind her companion(s) alone: this bhikkhunī, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p id="sg-4"><strong>4.</strong> Should any bhikkhunī — without having obtained permission from the Community who performed the act, without knowing the desire of the group — restore a bhikkhunī whom a Community acting harmony in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher’s instructions, has suspended: this bhikkhunī, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community. [See Cv.I.28-29]</p>

<p id="sg-5"><strong>5.</strong> Should any bhikkhunī, lusting, having received staple or non-staple food from the hand of a lusting man, consume or chew it: this bhikkhunī, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

<p>And should that bhikkhunī, thus admonished by the bhikkhunīs, persist as before, the bhikkhunīs are to rebuke her up to three times for the sake of relinquishing that.

Whatever the offense she has committed, she is to be dealt with in accordance with the rule; and in addition, her deceit is to be exposed: “It is no gain for you, lady, it is ill-done, that when the Pāṭimokkha is being recited, you do not pay attention, properly taking it to heart.” As for the deception (§), it is to be confessed.</p>

<h3 id="pc-part16">Part Sixteen: The In-accordance -with-the-Rule Chapter</h3>

But when a bhikkhunī has picked up or had (someone) pick up a valuable or what is considered a valuable (left) in a monastery or in a dwelling, she is to keep it, (thinking,) “Whoever it belongs to will (come and) fetch it.” This is the proper course here.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="as">Adhikaraṇa-Samatha</h2>

<p id="as-1"><strong>1.</strong> <em>A face-to-face verdict should be given.</em> This means that the transaction settling the issue must be carried out in the presence of the Community, in the presence of the individuals, and in the presence of the Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

<p id="as-2"><strong>2.</strong> <em>A verdict of mindfulness may be given.</em> This is the verdict of innocence given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused remembers fully that she did not commit the offense in question.</p>

<p id="as-3"><strong>3.</strong> <em>A verdict of past insanity may be given.</em> This is another verdict of innocence given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused was out of her mind when she committed the offense in question and so is absolved of any responsibility for it.</p>

<p id="as-4"><strong>4.</strong> <em>Acting in accordance with what is admitted</em>. This refers to the ordinary confession of offenses, where no formal interrogation is involved. The confession is valid only if in accord with the facts, e.g., a bhikkhunī actually commits a pācittiya offense and then confesses it as such, and not as a stronger or lesser offense. If she were to confess it as a dukkata or a Saṅghādisesa, that would be invalid.</p>

<p id="as-5"><strong>5.</strong> <em>Acting in accordance with the majority.</em> This refers to cases in which bhikkhunīs are unable to settle a dispute unanimously, even after all the proper procedures are followed, and — in the words of the Canon — are “wounding one another with weapons of the tongue.” In cases such as these, decisions can be made by majority vote.</p>

<p id="as-6"><strong>6.</strong> <em>Acting for her (the accused’s) further punishment.</em> This refers to cases where a bhikkhunī admits to having committed the offense in question only after being formally interrogated about it. She is then to be reproved for her actions, made to remember the offense and to confess it, after which the Community carries out a “further punishment” transaction against her as an added punishment for being so uncooperative as to require the formal interrogation in the first place.</p>

<p id="as-7"><strong>7.</strong> <em>Covering over as with grass.</em> This refers to situations in which both sides of a dispute realize that, in the course of their dispute, they have done much that is unworthy of a contemplative. If they were to deal with one another for their offenses, the only result would be greater divisiveness. Thus if both sides agree, all the bhikkhunīs gather in one place. (According to the Commentary, this means that all bhikkhunīs in the Community territory <em>(sima)</em> must attend. No one should send her consent, and even sick bhikkhunīs must go.) A motion is made to the entire group that this procedure will be followed. One member of each side then makes a formal motion to the members of her faction that she will make a confession for them. When both sides are ready, the representative of each side addresses the entire group and makes the blanket confession, using the form of a motion and one announcement (<em>ñatti-dutiya-kamma</em>).</p>

  <p><a href="#fnt-1" id="fn-1">1</a>.&nbsp; The syntax of this rule allows for two interpretations of the phrase, “with the Dhamma, with the Vinaya, with the teacher’s instructions.” BD, BN, and N all take it as connected with the phrase, “disrespectful, has not made amends, has broken off his friendship” thus: “he is disrespectful, has not made amends, has broken off his friendship with the Dhamma, with the Vinaya, with the teacher’s instructions.” I, however, follow the Commentary in connecting it with the term “suspended.” An argument for ignoring the Commentary here might be that its interpretation does not follow normal sentence order. An argument for following it would be that (1) the formal legal language of training rules sometimes deviates from normal sentence order and (2) the word “disrespectful,” for one, takes the locative case for its object, not the instrumental, which is used here. With regard to point (1), the word order in the relevant sentence might be explained by the fact that there was a need to separate “Community,” also in the instrumental, from the instrumentals in the phrase “in line with the Dhamma,” etc.</p>
<p>There is also a good practical reason to follow the Commentary here, in that if the Community of bhikkhus acting in unity suspended the bhikkhu in question in a transaction that was not in line with the Dhamma, the Vinaya, the teacher’s instructions, then there is no good reason that the bhikkhunī following him should be subject to this rule.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-2" id="fn-2">2</a>.&nbsp; When a Community’s kathina privileges are in effect, all cloth presented to the their residence is in-season cloth, and it is to be distributed only among the residents who spent the Rains-residence in that residence and participated in the spreading of the kathina (see Mv.VII.1.3). Other bhikkhunīs have no share in it. However, if donors wish to give cloth to those other bhikkhunīs, they can declare their intention, in which the cloth — even though given “in-season” — counts as out-of-season cloth. In this case, the later arrivals have a right to a share. In the origin story to this rule, donors make such a gift. The offending bhikkhunī, not wanting to share the gift with the later arrivals for whom it was intended, declares it to be in-season cloth, and shares it only with the bhikkhunīs who spent the Rains-residence in that residence.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-3" id="fn-3">3</a>.&nbsp; The origin story here shows that lay donors, of their own initiative, set the fund aside with a storekeeper for one purpose, and then the bhikkhunī asks for it to be transferred — apparently to another store — and buys something else with it. This condition also applies to <a href="#np-9">NP 9</a> &amp; <a href="#np-10">NP 10</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-4" id="fn-4">4</a>.&nbsp; Horner, when coming to this rule in her translation of BD (in the volume first published in 1942) converted this rule to the exact opposite of its actual meaning, thus: “Whatever nun should let the hair of the body grow, there is an offence of expiation.” However, when she came to the parallel rules for the bhikkhus (in the volume of BD first published in 1952), she realized her earlier mistake and, in footnote 2 on page 186, noted that the verb here means to “remove” rather than to “grow.” N (published in 2001) apparently missed this footnote, and so repeated the earlier mistake.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-5" id="fn-5">5</a>.&nbsp; This rule was formulated after bhikkhunīs went off on a journey without their outer robes, thus inconveniencing the bhikkhunīs who stayed behind, who had to sun the robes to keep them from going moldy. The Word-commentary states that a bhikkhunī, at least once every five days, must put on or dry in the sun all five of her robes: this is the five-day outer robe period.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-6" id="fn-6">6</a>.&nbsp; BD translates the word for throne here — <em>pallaṇka</em> — as “divan,” and in its translation of the Bhikkhunī Vibhanga states that the divan is allowable if the “hair” is removed. Actually, the word in question — <em>vāla</em> — means “animal,” not “hair.” It refers to the fact that a throne was decorated with carved animals, and that it would be allowable for bhikkhunīs if the carvings were removed.</p>

  <p><a href="#fnt-7" id="fn-7">7</a>.&nbsp; BD misinterprets not only the rule here, but also its explanatory material in the Bhikkhunī Vibhanga. The Pāli of the rule is: <em>Ya pana bhikkhunī gihi-veyyavaccam kareyya, pacittiyanti.</em> BD translates it as: “Whatever nun should do household work, there is an offence of expiation.” <em>Gihi,</em> however, means lay person or, more literally, “house-person,” not household. This is confirmed by the word-commentary’s definition of <em>gihi-veyyavaccam:</em> “She cooks conjey or a meal or a non-staple food, or washes a piece of clothing or a head-wrap for a person living in a house <em>(agarika).”</em></p>
	<p>In the non-offense clauses, BD translates <em>attano veyyavaccakarassa</em> as “in doing household work for herself.” This omits the <em>–kara-</em> in the second term, thus changing <em>veyyavaccakara</em> (chore-doer) to <em>veyyavacca</em> (chore). The correct translation is, “for her own chore-doer.”</p>
	<p>Thus the non-offense clauses, as a set, read: “There is no offense in conjey-drink, in a Community meal, in homage to a chedi, or if she cooks conjey or a meal or a non-staple food, or washes a piece of clothing or a head-wrap for her own chore-doer.” The Commentary explains: <strong>“In conjey-drink, etc.:</strong> When people are making a Community meal or a conjey-drink for the purpose of the Community, there is no offense in her doing any cooking at all in the position of being their friend. <strong>In homage to a chedi: </strong>It is all right if, being a friend, she does homage with scents, etc. <strong>For her own chore-doer:</strong> Even if (her) mother and father come and are making/doing something (such as) a fan or a broom handle and so stand in the position of a chore-doer, it is all right to cook anything (for them).”</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-8" id="fn-8">8</a>.&nbsp; In the origin story, a bhikkhunī spreads lies about the road to a particular family’s house, saying that it is infested with fierce dogs and a wild bull, in order to discourage other bhikkhunīs from going there and receiving a share of the family’s donations.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-9" id="fn-9">9</a>.&nbsp; The six precepts are the first six of the novice’s ten precepts: abstaining from taking life, from taking what is not given, from sexual intercourse, from telling lies, from taking intoxicants, and from eating food in the “wrong time,” i.e., from noon to the following dawn.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-10" id="fn-10">10</a>.&nbsp; This rule could also be translated as concerning a married woman less than twelve years old, but the procedure for a bhikkhunī’s Acceptance shows that the candidate must be at least twenty years old in any case (see Cv.X.17.1, repeated at Cv.X.17.5 and Cv.X.17.6). Thus the twelve years here apparently refers to the candidate’s having been married for twelve years. The word for “married” in the rule — <em>gihigatā</em> — is not normally used for formal marriage. The Vibhanga explains it with the term <em>purisantaragatā,</em> which means a woman living with a man (see DN 8). Thus, apparently, the term “married” here would cover both a woman who has been formally married and one who has simply been living with a man in an informal arrangement.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-11" id="fn-11">11</a>.&nbsp; In the origin story, the new bhikkhunī’s husband seizes her right after her ordination.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-12" id="fn-12">12</a>.&nbsp; “Stale giving of consent” <em>(parivasika-chanda-dana)</em> means that consent has been given by the Community of bhikkhus in that territory for a particular group to conduct Community business, but then the group gets up and leaves before dealing with the issue in question (on this point, see Mv.II.36.4). In the origin story for this rule, the offending bhikkhunī dismisses the group that had received consent to carry out the Acceptance transaction and then — under the ruse of the consent given to that group — convenes another group of bhikkhus less likely to pay attention to the deficiencies in the candidate she is proposing. N suggests that “stale” here means “postponed overnight,” but that is not necessarily the case. The postponement might last less than a day.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-13" id="fn-13">13</a>.&nbsp; Asking a question related to the Vinaya can be the first step in admonishment and making accusations (see Mv.II.15.6-8), which is why this rule is related to the eighth of the eight vows of respect (against a bhikkhunī admonishing a bhikkhu). As Horner notes in BD, the word-commentary to this rule is one of the few places in the Vinaya that apparently refers to the Abhidhamma as a text — thus indicating that either the rule or its word-commentary is a later formulation.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-14" id="fn-14">14</a>.&nbsp; “An unordained person”: The Pāli here has the feminine form — unordained female person — but none of the commentaries explain why.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt-15" id="fn-15">15</a>.&nbsp; “An unordained person”: Again, the Pāli here has the feminine form — unordained female person — but none of the commentaries explain why.</p>
