        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_57.html">SN&thinsp;22:57</a>&nbsp; Sattaṭṭhāna Sutta | Seven Bases</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; The Buddha recommends knowing each aggregate in terms of the aggregate itself, its origination, its cessation, the path of practice leading to its cessation, its allure, its drawbacks, and the escape from it. He also describes three ways of investigating the aggregates: in terms of the six sense media, in terms of properties, and in terms of dependent co-arising.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_58.html">SN&thinsp;22:58</a>&nbsp; Buddha Sutta | Awakened</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; Some schools of Buddhism teach that there is a qualitative difference between the liberation of a Buddha and that of an arahant disciple — namely, that a Buddha awakens to one level of truth, whereas an arahant awakens to another.

Here, however, the Buddha points out that people are attached to things because they pay attention to the pleasure offered by those things, and ignore the stress they cause.</li>

        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_80.html">SN&thinsp;22:80</a>&nbsp; Piṇḍolya Sutta | Almsgoers</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; After having dismissed the monks, the Buddha returns to teach them out of compassion for the monks newly gone-forth.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_81.html">SN&thinsp;22:81</a>&nbsp; Pālileyyaka Sutta | At Pālileyyaka</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; After the Buddha has gone into seclusion, Ven. Ānanda leads a group of monks to visit him and to hear the Dhamma. The Buddha responds by addressing the question, “Knowing in what way, seeing in what way, does one without delay put an end to effluents?”</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_82.html">SN&thinsp;22:82</a>&nbsp; Puṇṇama Sutta | The Full-moon Night</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; A thorough discussion of issues related to the five aggregates. Toward the end of the discussion, a monk thinks that he has found a loophole in the teaching. The way the Buddha handles this incident shows the proper use of the teachings on the aggregates: not as a metaphysical theory, but as a tool for gaining dispassion for clinging—and, as a result, release.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_83.html">SN&thinsp;22:83</a>&nbsp; Ānanda Sutta | Ānanda</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; Ven. Ānanda recalls the Dhamma explanation, given by Ven. Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta (see <a href="/suttas/MN/MN24.html" class="nobutton">MN&nbsp;24</a>), that enabled him to break through to the Dhamma.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_84.html">SN&thinsp;22:84</a>&nbsp; Tissa Sutta | Tissa</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; The Buddha comforts and encourages one of his cousins who has become dissatisfied with the holy life. He concludes with a simile, comparing the noble eightfold path to a path going through a dense forest (ignorance), a marshy swamp (sensual desires), past a steep drop-off (anger &amp; despair), and finally arriving at a patch of level ground: unbinding.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_85.html">SN&thinsp;22:85</a>&nbsp; Yamaka Sutta | To Yamaka</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; Ven. Sāriputta teaches the Dhamma to a monk who has given rise to an evil view: that an arahant, after death, does not exist.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_86.html">SN&thinsp;22:86</a>&nbsp; Anurādha Sutta | To Anurādha</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; The Buddha teaches the Dhamma to a monk who thinks that, after death, a Tathāgata can be described as something other than existing, not existing, both, or neither.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_88.html">SN&thinsp;22:88</a>&nbsp; Assaji Sutta | To Assaji</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; The Buddha teaches a sick monk who is concerned that he cannot attain the level of concentration he had before falling ill.</li>

        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN56_32.html">SN&thinsp;56:32</a>&nbsp; Khadira Sutta | Acacia</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; Bringing about the end of stress without breaking through to the four noble truths is as impossible as carrying water in a basket woven from tiny leaves.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN56_35.html">SN&thinsp;56:35</a>&nbsp; Sattisata Sutta | One Hundred Spears</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; If it were possible to make an offer that you would be speared by 300 spears a day for 100 years, yet be guaranteed a realization of the four noble truths at the end of the 100 years, why it would be worthwhile to take the offer.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/SN/SN56_36.html">SN&thinsp;56:36</a>&nbsp; Pāṇa Sutta | Animals</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; An image for the immensity of the animal realm as a realm of deprivation, and how one can be freed from returning to that realm by contemplating the four noble truths.</li>
