            <h3 class="no-highlight"><a href="/suttas/introduction.html">Introduction</a></h3>
            <div></div>
            <h3>How to …</h3>
            <div class="subset">
              <p>Some prefer to learn by trial and error; others prefer an explanation. This short guide to using this “accordion” table of contents is for the latter.</p>
              <p>There are three fundamental actions, 1) following links, 2) expanding, and 3) collapsing.</p>
              <p><strong>1)&nbsp; Links,</strong> which navigate to a new page, usually to a sutta, will always appear as a <em>rounded white button</em> on a gray panel, like the “Translator’s note,” above.</p>
              <p>After following the link, if you hit the <em>back button</em> on your browser, it will return you to same place, and with the accordion in the same expanded state, as you were before. This is useful for reading suttas sequentially.</p>
              <p>If instead you hit the <em>home button</em> on the footer, it will return you to the accordion in its default, collapsed state. This might be useful for those who want to start fresh without having to manually close a bunch of subsections.</p>
              <p><strong>2)&nbsp; Expanding</strong> the accordion to reveal a) another subsection or b) a short summary of the referenced sutta, is accomplished by <em>clicking on the gray panel</em>.</p>
              <p>Sometimes a white link button will appear by itself without any text at all in the gray panel. In these cases there is nothing to expand, and clicking on anything other than the link itself will simply result in nothing happening. If there is something to expand, there will always be some kind of text in the gray, even if only a minimal indicator, such as the ellipses (…) alongside the links to the Itivuttaka suttas.</p>
              <p>Also, <em>on desktops and laptops only,</em> the field will turn orange when hovering with the mouse cursor if expansion is possible, and remain gray if not.</p>
              <p><strong>3)&nbsp; Collapsing</strong> subsections of the accordion has to be done manually for technical reasons. There are incidental benefits, though, for being able to maintain a number of subsections or descriptions open without the accordion automatically closing those you previously opened. Ultimately, for the sake of simplicity and control, it’s left to the user to manually expand and collapse the various subsections and descriptions by <em>toggling the gray panels.</em></p>
              <p><em>On smart phones and tablets only,</em> the last tapped gray panel will turn orange and stay that way until something else is tapped. This may prove helpful in finding your previous position in the table of contents after an insouciant scrolling binge.</p>
              <p><strong>Alternatively</strong> a non-accordion style table of contents, where the short descriptions of the suttas are not hidden by default, is also available. See “Default sutta index,” below.</p>
            </div><!--end subset-->
            <h3>Offline edition …</h3>
            <div class="subset">
              <p>The sutta translations can also be browsed and read offline by downloading an eBook version. The entire <a href="/ebook_index.html#handfulOfLeaves">Sutta Piṭaka</a>, with full hyperlinked cross-references provides a similar, if not superior experience, to online browsing (or even offline browsing with a mirrored website stored locally). Page loading and following cross-references are snappier without internet latency, and the eBooks have some additional features like nested tables of contents, bookmarking, note taking and highlighting. There&rsquo;s also the ability to load them onto handheld devices and eReaders like the Kindle or Kobe, and eReaders are particularly good for taking into the wilderness because of their light weight and extremely long battery life.</p>
              <p>Due to the internal structure of the eBooks (specifically the epub, azw3 and mobi formats), even very large ones like this hardly lag in navigation and page rendering, even on the oldest, smallest and most underpowered devices. On a computer, the responsiveness is immediate. Large pdfs, on the other hand, are basically unusable on small devices, and not recommended even for powerful computers.</p>
              <p>All that is needed is an eReader. For Kindles, the azw3 format is better, but the mobi also works. For everything else, the epub format is the best. For a laptop or desktop computer, <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a> is free and excellent eReader software that works on Windows, OSX and Linux. For Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ebookdroid">eBookDroid</a> is free and popular, and the iPhone has iBooks installed by default.</p>

    <h1 class="suttasans">Dīgha Nikāya …</h1>
      <div>
          <h2>.: The Long Collection :.</h2>
<p>The Dīgha Nikāya, or Long Collection, is named after the length not of the collection, but of its individual suttas. There are 34 in all, many of them among the most polished literary compositions in the Pali Canon. This anthology contains complete translations of twelve suttas, and partial translations of two.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN01.html">DN 1</a><span>Brahmajāla Sutta | The Brahmā Net</span></h2>
<p>An introductory portrait of the Buddha, dealing both with the minor reasons for which people might praise him—his virtues—and the more subtle and profound reasons for praising him: his comprehension of the difference between right and wrong view, and the release that comes from going beyond both. The Buddha uses right view about kamma and dependent co-arising to analyze 62 instances of wrong view, focusing less on the content of the views and more on the kamma of clinging to them: what actions give rise to them, and the destinations that come from acting on them. His analysis shows that right view, used in this way, is superior because it leads to the highest freedom.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN02.html">DN 2</a><span>Sāmaññaphala Sutta | The Fruits of the Contemplative Life</span></h2>
<p>King Ajātasattu, disappointed with the other spiritual teachers of the day, approaches the Buddha and asks, “What are the fruits of the contemplative life, visible in the here and now?” His account of why other teachers disappointed him with their answers to this question shows clearly both what the Dhamma is not and also how a teacher should not teach: In all the cases, the teachers present a canned doctrine that doesn’t address the question. The Buddha’s answer, which does address the question, gives a comprehensive account of what the Dhamma is—a path of training leading to a clear goal—illustrating each stage of the training with vivid similes.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN09.html">DN 9</a><span>Poṭṭhapāda Sutta | About Poṭṭhapāda</span></h2>
<p>Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer presents the Buddha with a series of questions on the topic of perception. In response, the Buddha shows his skill as a teacher—adopting, for Poṭṭhapāda’s sake, the terms in which the questions are phrased, but then giving those terms new meanings, in line with the practice of the Dhamma.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN11.html">DN 11</a><span>Kevaṭṭa Sutta | To Kevaṭṭa</span></h2>
<p>This discourse explores the role of miracles and conversations with heavenly beings as a possible basis for faith and belief. The Buddha does not deny the reality of such experiences, but he points out that—of all possible miracles—the only reliable one is the miracle of instruction in the proper training of the mind. As for heavenly beings, they are subject to greed, anger, and delusion, and so the information they give—especially with regard to the miracle of instruction—is not necessarily trustworthy. Thus the only valid basis for faith is the instruction that, when followed, brings about the end of one’s own mental defilements. The tale that concludes the discourse is one of the finest examples of the early Buddhist sense of humor.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN12.html">DN 12</a><span>Lohicca Sutta | To Lohicca</span></h2>
<p>When a person gains awakening and then teaches the path to others, doesn’t he or she necessarily get involved in fruitless entanglements? Shouldn’t such a person, to avoid criticism, remain silent? The Buddha addresses these questions, showing that they are motivated by ill will, and then sets out the standards for measuring whether a teacher can or cannot legitimately be criticized.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN15.html">DN 15</a><span>Mahā Nidāna Sutta | The Great Causes Discourse</span></h2>
<p>One of the most profound discourses in the Pali Canon, giving an extended treatment of the teachings of dependent co-arising <em>(paṭicca samuppāda)</em> and not-self <em>(anattā)</em> in an outlined context of how these teachings function in practice.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN16.html">DN 16</a><span>Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta | The Great Total Unbinding Discourse</span></h2>
<p>This vast discourse, a memorial to the Buddha, narrates the events of the last year of his life and the weeks immediately following his total unbinding. As with any memorial, the narrative seems to be shaped by two concerns: the desire (1) to show that the person memorialized was worthy of love and respect, and (2) to indicate the importance of continuing to live by the good traditions that the person established. In particular, this sutta presents both a detailed etiquette for how the Buddha should be honored, and a more summary account of how the Dhamma should be practiced in a way to keep it alive. Its account shows how a devotional attitude to the Buddha does not have to conflict with the practice of the Dhamma, and how, in fact, the practice of the Dhamma is the best way to show homage to the Buddha.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN20.html">DN 20</a><span>Mahā Samaya Sutta | The Great Meeting</span></h2>
<p>A large group of devas pays a visit to the Buddha one night, and the Buddha tells the monks, in a long poem, the names of the major devas who came to see him. This sutta is the closest thing in the Pali Canon to a “Who’s Who” of the deva worlds, providing useful material for anyone interested in the cosmology of early Buddhism.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN21.html">DN 21</a><span>Sakka-pañha Sutta | Sakka’s Questions (Excerpt)</span></h2>
<p>In this excerpt, Sakka, the deva-king, asks the Buddha about the sources of conflict, and about the path of practice that can bring it to an end. This discourse ends with a humorous account about Sakka’s frustration in trying to learn the Dhamma from other contemplatives. It's hard to find a teacher when you’re a king.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN22.html">DN 22</a><span>Mahā Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta | The Great Establishing of Mindfulness Discourse</span></h2>
<p>This sutta sets out the full formula for the practice of establishing mindfulness, and then gives an extensive account of one phrase in the formula: what it means to remain focused on any of the four frames of reference—body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities—in and of itself.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN26.html">DN 26</a><span>Cakkavatti Sutta | The Wheel-turning Emperor (Excerpt)</span></h2>
<p>In this excerpt, the Buddha tells the monks of the rewards that come from staying in their own “ancestral territory,” i.e., the four establishings of mindfulness.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN29.html">DN 29</a><span>Pāsādika Sutta | The Inspiring Discourse</span></h2>
<p>Toward the end of his life, the Buddha describes his accomplishment in establishing, through the Dhamma and Vinaya, a complete holy life that will endure after his passing. Listing some of the criticisms that might be leveled against him and his Dhamma-Vinaya, he shows how those criticisms should be refuted.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN33.html">DN 33</a><span>Saṅgīti Sutta | The Discourse for Reciting Together</span></h2>
<p>A large compilation of lists of dhammas arranged numerically, from lists with one member to lists with ten.</p>
<h2><a href="/suttas/DN/DN34.html">DN 34</a><span>Dasuttara Sutta | Progressing by Tens</span></h2>
<p>A second large compilation of lists of dhammas, arranged both numerically and according to function.</p>
    </div>

  <h1 class="suttasans">Majjhima Nikāya …</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>.: The Middle Collection :.</h2>
    <p>The Majjhima Nikāya — the Middle Collection — is the second collection in the Sutta Piṭaka. It takes its name from the length of the discourses it contains: shorter than those in the Long Collection, longer than those in the Connected and Numerical Collections. There are 152 suttas in all. This anthology offers complete translations of 100 of these suttas, and excerpts from three.</p>
    <h2>MN 1–33 …</h2>
    <div>
        <h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN1.html">MN 1</a><span>Mūlapariyāya Sutta | The Root Sequence</span></h3>
<p>The Majjhima Nikāya opens with one of the few suttas where his listeners did NOT delight in his words. In it, the Buddha dismisses the tendency—common both in his time and in ours—to posit a metaphysical principle from which the universe emanates.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN2.html">MN 2</a><span>Sabbāsava Sutta | All the Effluents</span></h3>
<p>The Buddha lists seven approaches for eliminating the āsavas, or effluents: deep-seated defilements that “flow out” of the mind and prevent liberation.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN4.html">MN 4</a><span>Bhaya-bherava Sutta | Fear &amp; Terror</span></h3>
<p>The qualities of mind necessary for living in the wilderness without fear.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN5.html">MN 5</a><span>Anaṅgaṇa Sutta | Unblemished</span></h3>
<p>Ven. Sāriputta explains the blemishes of the mind: the influences of evil, unskillful wishes.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN6.html">MN 6</a><span>Ākaṅkheyya Sutta | If One Would Wish</span></h3>
<p>The wishes that can be fulfilled by bringing the precepts to perfection, being committed to inner tranquility of awareness, not neglecting jhāna, being endowed with insight, and frequenting empty dwellings.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN7.html">MN 7</a><span>Vatthūpama Sutta | The Simile of the Cloth</span></h3>
<p>A mind cleansed of defilements is like a piece of cloth cleansed of stains. This sutta also addresses beliefs related to the washing away of sins.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN9.html">MN 9</a><span>Sammādiṭṭhi Sutta | Right View</span></h3>
<p>Ven. Sāriputta explains how the four noble truths, dependent co-arising, and the ending of the effluents can be derived from the basic dichotomy of skillful and unskillful actions.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN10.html">MN 10</a><span>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta | The Establishing of Mindfulness Discourse</span></h3>
<p>This sutta sets out the full formula for the practice of establishing mindfulness, and then gives an extensive account of one phrase in the formula: what it means to remain focused on any of the four frames of reference—body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities—in and of itself.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN11.html">MN 11</a><span>Cūḷasīhanāda Sutta | The Shorter Lion’s Roar Discourse</span></h3>
<p>If you don’t fully comprehend clinging, you can’t gain awakening.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN12.html">MN 12</a><span>Mahāsīhanāda Sutta | The Great Lion’s Roar Discourse</span></h3>
<p>The Buddha describes something of the range of his knowledge and powers.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN13.html">MN 13</a><span>Mahā Dukkhakkhandha Sutta | The Great Mass of Stress</span></h3>
<p>With graphic similes, this sutta describes the allure, the drawbacks, and the escape from sensuality, physical form, and feeling.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN14.html">MN 14</a><span>Cūḷa Dukkhakkhandha Sutta | The Lesser Mass of Stress</span></h3>
<p>How the pleasure of jhāna, rather than the practice of austerities, is what allows the mind both to avoid the drawbacks that come from attachment to sensual pleasures and to achieve the even greater pleasure of unbinding.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN17.html">MN 17</a><span>Vanapattha Sutta | Forest Hinterlands</span></h3>
<p>Standards a monk should use in deciding where to live and practice.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/MN/MN18.html">MN 18</a><span>Madhupiṇḍika Sutta | The Ball of Honey</span></h3>
<p>A brahman looking for a debate asks the Buddha a question. The Buddha’s answer stymies him, and when the Buddha later explains his answer to the monks before returning to his dwelling, they are mystified as well. At their request, Ven.

(1) If you're engaging in wrong livelihood, don't expect to escape the karmic consequences even if you're doing it to fulfill your duties to your family, parents, or friends.

<p>A thorough discussion of issues related to the five aggregates. Toward the end of the discussion, a monk thinks that he has found a loophole in the teaching.

    <h2>.: The Connected Collection :.</h2>
    <p>The Saṁyutta Nikāya, a collection of short to medium-length discourses, takes its name from the way the discourses are organized into groups connected (saṁyutta) by a particular theme. In some cases, the theme is a topic. In others it may be the name of an interlocutor, a place, a group of people, or—as in the Simile-Connected discourses—a formal attribute of the discourses themselves. The complete collection, counting all its formulaic expansions, contains more than 2,900 discourses, of which 450 are translated here.</p>

<p>The Buddha describes the highest level of right view, in which the mind abandons thoughts of existence and non-existence, and sees all arising and passing away as stress <em>(dukkha)</em>.</p>

<p>This discourse describes the link between fabrications and consciousness in dependent co-arising, and shows how intention and underlying obsessions—with ignorance of the four noble truths being the basis for all obsessions—play a role in constructing awareness of the present moment.</p>

<p>Ven. Sāriputta analyses the factors of dependent co-arising down to a mutual dependence between consciousness on the one hand, and name-&-form on the other.</p>

<h3><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_58.html">SN 22:58</a><span>Buddha Sutta | Awakened</span></h3>
<p>Some schools of Buddhism teach that there is a qualitative difference between the liberation of a Buddha and that of an arahant disciple — namely, that a Buddha awakens to one level of truth, whereas an arahant awakens to another.

<p>A thorough discussion of issues related to the five aggregates. Toward the end of the discussion, a monk thinks that he has found a loophole in the teaching. The way the Buddha handles this incident shows the proper use of the teachings on the aggregates: not as a metaphysical theory, but as a tool for gaining dispassion for clinging—and, as a result, release.</p>
<h3><a href="/suttas/SN/SN22_83.html">SN 22:83</a><span>Ānanda Sutta | Ānanda</span></h3>

    <div>
    <h2>.: The Numerical Collection :.</h2>
    <p>The Aṅguttara Nikāya, a collection of short to medium-length discourses, takes its name from the way the discourses are grouped by the number of their parts <em>(aṅga),</em> with the number growing progressively higher <em>(uttara)</em> with each group. No single English term can convey the full meaning of this name, although the translation <em>Numerical Collection</em> gives a workable idea of the principle behind it. The complete collection, counting all its formulaic expansions, contains more than 9,500 discourses. When these expansions are not counted, the total comes to approximately 2,300 discourses, of which 423 are translated here.</p>

    <h2>Itivuttaka …</h2>
    <div>
    <h3>.: This was said by the Buddha :.</h3>
    <p>A collection of 112 short discourses, it takes its name from the statement at the beginning of each of its discourses: this <em>(iti)</em> was said <em>(vuttaṁ)</em> by the Blessed One. The collection as a whole is attributed to a laywoman named Khujjuttarā, who worked in the palace of King Udena of Kosambī as a servant to one of his queens, Sāmāvati. Because the Queen could not leave the palace to hear the Buddha’s discourses, Khujjuttarā went in her place, memorized what the Buddha said, and then returned to the palace to teach the Queen and her 500 ladies-in-waiting. For her efforts, the Buddha cited Khujjuttarā as the foremost of his laywomen disciples in terms of her learning. She was also an effective teacher: when the inner apartments of the palace later burned down, killing the Queen and her entourage, the Buddha commented (in <a href="/suttas/KN/Ud/ud7_10.html">Udāna 7:10</a>) that all of the women had reached at least the first stage of awakening.</p>

    <h3>.: The Discourse Group :.</h3>
            <p>The collection includes some of the most famous poems in the Pali Canon. It also contains two sets of poems that were apparently well-known in the Buddha’s time as deep expressions of advanced points of doctrine: the Aṭṭhaka Vagga, a set of sixteen poems on the theme of non-clinging, and the Pārāyana Vagga, a set of sixteen dialogues, with a prologue and epilogue, in which the Buddha provides succinct answers to questions posed to him by brahmans who appear to have been adept in concentration practice. In addition to these more well-known poems, the collection also contains many useful instructions of a highly practical nature, covering everything from the most basic standards of conduct to the most subtle issues of discernment.</p>

    <h3>.: Poems of the Elder Monks :.</h3>
    <p>This is an anthology consisting of 97 poems from the Theragāthā (Poems of the Elder Monks). It is the eighth text in the Khuddaka Nikāya. The Theragāthā contains a total of 264 poems, all attributed to early members of the monastic Saṅgha. Some of the poems are attributed to monks well-known from other parts of the Canon—such as Ānanda and Mahā Kassapa—whereas the majority are attributed to monks otherwise unknown. It is a landmark in the history of world literature. The Theragāthā contains the earliest extant descriptions extolling the beauties, not of domesticated nature, but of nature where it’s wild.</p>

    <div>
    <h3>.: Poems of the Elder Nuns :.</h3>
    <p>This is an anthology consisting of 34 poems from the Therīgāthā (Poems of the Elder Nuns). It is the ninth text in the Khuddaka Nikāya. The Therīgāthā contains a total of 73 poems, all attributed to early members of the monastic Saṅgha. Some of the poems are attributed to nuns well-known from other parts of the Canon—such as Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and Uppalavaṇṇā—whereas the majority are attributed to nuns otherwise unknown. It is a landmark in the history of world literature. The Therīgāthā is the earliest extant text depicting women’s spiritual experiences.</p>
