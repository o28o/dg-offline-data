        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/AN/AN11_1.html">AN&thinsp;11:1</a>&nbsp; Kimattha Sutta | What is the Purpose?</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; Beginning with skillful virtues, and ascending all the way through dispassion, the Buddha discusses the purpose and reward of different aspects of the practice, showing how the more basic parts of the practice have the higher ones as their reward.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/AN/AN11_2.html">AN&thinsp;11:2</a>&nbsp; Cetanā Sutta | An Act of Will</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; How the more basic parts of the practice lead naturally to the higher ones.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/AN/AN11_10.html">AN&thinsp;11:10</a>&nbsp; Sandha Sutta | To Sandha</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; Using the simile of the thoughts that absorb a thoroughbred horse as opposed to the thoughts that absorb an unbroken colt, the Buddha describes the jhāna of an arahant as opposed to the “jhāna” of one who has not found escape from the five hindrances.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/AN/AN11_12.html">AN&thinsp;11:12</a>&nbsp; Mahānāma Sutta | To Mahānāma (1)</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; When the Buddha and the monks prepare to leave at the end of the Rains retreat, Mahānāma—a streamwinner—asks the Buddha what he should meditate on in their absence. The Buddha advises developing the five strengths and practicing recollection of six things: the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Saṅgha, his own virtue, his own generosity, and the virtues of the devas that are found within him.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/AN/AN11_13.html">AN&thinsp;11:13</a>&nbsp; Mahānāma Sutta | To Mahānāma (2)</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; The same situation and question as in the preceding sutta, with the same answer expressed in slightly different terms.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/suttas/AN/AN11_16.html">AN&thinsp;11:16</a>&nbsp; Mettā Sutta | Goodwill</strong> &nbsp;—&nbsp; The eleven rewards of developing goodwill as an awareness release.</li>
